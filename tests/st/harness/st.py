"""How a system test declares its cases.

A case must be a **collection-time value**, not a statement inside the test
body.  The pre-compile pool has to know every case before any test body runs,
and the only way to hand pytest a value that early is to parametrize with it::

    from harness import st
    from examples.beginner.abs import tile_abs   # @pl.jit.incore

    @st.cases(
        st.case(tile_abs, a, out, golden=lambda t: torch.abs(t["a"])),
    )
    def test_tile_abs(case_run):
        case_run.assert_passed()

``st.cases`` is a thin wrapper over ``pytest.mark.parametrize``, so the case
object lands in ``item.callspec.params["_st_case"]`` and the harness reads it
directly.  It replaces the previous discovery route, which parsed the test
function's source and re-evaluated its constructor call with a miniature AST
interpreter — a route that could not see a ``@pl.jit`` test at all, and that
fell back silently to per-case inline compilation whenever an argument would
not resolve.

Usage note: declare the case at module level or inside the decorator call.
Building it inside the test body puts it back out of reach of collection.

    The kernel source is chosen from what *kernel* is, so the test does not
    name it: a ``@pl.jit`` function becomes a ``JitKernel``, an ``ir.Program``
    an ``IRKernel``, anything else (a ``@pl.program`` class, or a factory
    returning one) a ``ProgramKernel``.

    Args:
        kernel: The kernel under test.
        *sample_args: Sample tensors, positionally, for a ``@pl.jit`` kernel.
            They carry the shape/dtype contract and are the case's real inputs,
            so the tensor list is derived from them.
        name: Case identity — the artifact cache key and the parametrize id.
            Defaults to a name derived from the kernel and its specialization.
        inputs: Sample tensors by parameter name, for a ``@pl.jit`` kernel that
            reads better bound by keyword. Combines with *sample_args*.
        golden: Called once in the parent with every tensor by name; returns
            the output tensor, a dict of output name to tensor, or ``None``
            after mutating in place.
        tensors: Declare the tensor list explicitly. Required for a
            ``@pl.program`` / ``ir.Program`` kernel, which cannot derive it.
        scalars: Scalar TaskArg slots, after all tensor slots.
        platform: Pin one platform; ``None`` follows the session matrix.
        strategy: Pass-pipeline optimization strategy.
        memory_planner: On-chip memory planner.
        enable_pypto_l0c_double_buffer: Opt in to dbC=2 under the PyPTO planner.
        rtol: Relative tolerance for the default elementwise comparison.
        atol: Absolute tolerance for the default elementwise comparison.
        compare: Replace the elementwise comparison. Called in the parent as
            ``compare(actual, expected)`` with dicts of output name to tensor,
            and raises ``AssertionError`` to fail — the same ``assert`` the
            test wrote before it became a case. For an assertion that is not
            per-element, such as a Frobenius relative error::
