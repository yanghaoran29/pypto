"""Keep ``LaneInvariantArg`` declarations aligned with what type deduction can decide.

``LowerAutoVectorSplit`` decides whether an operand may stay full width under a halved result by
re-deducing the halved call (``HalvedCallStaysTypeConsistent``). That answer needs no metadata and
cannot go stale, so a registry declaration is only load-bearing for the operands the operator's own
``f_deduce_type`` never reads.

This module measures which operands those are, the same way the pass does: widen one tile operand on
one axis and ask the deducer again.

* deduction throws, or the deduced result changes -> the deducer **pins** that operand's extent, and
  the pass's type-consistency gate already decides it;
* deduction is unchanged -> the deducer is **blind** to it, and only a declaration can say whether
  full width is in contract.

Two things are then checked:

1. Every declared ``LaneInvariantArg.Scratch`` position names a blind operand. A declaration on a
   pinned operand is inert and actively misleading — it reads as "full width is fine here" while the
   operator's own deducer rejects that width. ``tile.rsqrt`` carried exactly such a declaration.
2. The blind positions match ``EXPECTED_BLIND_ARGS`` below. Adding an operator or loosening a
   deducer moves a position into that set, and the diff forces the question the model turns on: is
   this operand hardware scratch (declare it) or per-lane data (leave it undeclared, so the pass
   requires it to be sharded)?
