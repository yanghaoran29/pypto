Unit tests for PyPTO error handling and reporting.

This module tests the error classes exposed from C++ to Python, ensuring that:
1. Errors are properly raised and caught
2. Stack traces are captured and included in error messages
3. Error types map correctly to Python's built-in exceptions
4. Error inheritance works as expected
