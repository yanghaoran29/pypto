    Library code reaches ``pypto.runtime.device_runner`` through function-local

    device-only ``simpler`` package a hard dependency of ``pypto.runtime``.
    Patching an attribute on the real module therefore requires importing it
    first, which the unit-test runners cannot do; a stub module in
    ``sys.modules`` lets those lazy imports bind to mocks on every platform.

    layer's private functions, so renaming one stays a single edit here rather
    than a sweep over every test that stubs a dispatch.

    ``(chip_callable, runtime_name, runtime_config)`` triple and
