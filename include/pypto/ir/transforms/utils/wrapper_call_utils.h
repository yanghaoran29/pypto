/**
 * @brief Recover the true param directions of every Group / Spmd wrapper in
 *        @p program, keyed by `Function*`.
 *
 * Wrapper functions synthesised by the scope outliners forward their params
 * 1:1 to an inner kernel call, but their own `param_directions_` can still
 * read `In` for a param the inner kernel writes — the outliner infers
 * directions from the *body it extracted*, and later passes
 * (`ExpandMixedKernel`, `SplitVectorKernel`, ...) rebuild wrapper bodies
 * around new callees without revisiting the signature.
 *
 * For each wrapper this walks its body's inner calls and merges each inner
 * callee's direction back onto the wrapper param the arg refers to, matching
 * by Var pointer identity. Merge lattice: `InOut` > `Out` > `In`.
 *
 * The merge is **monotone**: it starts from each wrapper's declared directions
 * and only ever promotes (`In` → `Out` → `InOut`), never weakens a declared
 * writer to read-only. A wrapper with no body, no inner calls, or a param
 * written through a builtin instead of an inner call therefore keeps what its
 * signature already says.
 *
 * Nested and *mutually recursive* wrappers are resolved by iterating the
 * monotone transfer to its least fixed point over a worklist, so the result
 * does not depend on the order wrappers are visited: `A → B → A` converges to
 * the same directions whichever of the two is seeded first. (A recursive walk
 * with a cycle guard cannot promise that — the guard's fallback value leaks
 * into whichever wrapper the walk happened to enter first.)
 *
 * Whole-program rather than per-function because both callers iterate every
 * function: each wrapper body is walked exactly once, and each promotion moves
 * one param one step up the lattice, so the loop is bounded by twice the total
 * wrapper param count.
 *
 * `DeriveCallDirections` calls this and writes each result back into
 * `Function::param_directions_`, so every consumer downstream of that pass
 * reads the field directly instead of recomputing. Callers that run *before*
 * `DeriveCallDirections` and need the effective view must call this
 * explicitly.
 *
 * @return one entry per Group/Spmd function. Empty if @p program is null.
