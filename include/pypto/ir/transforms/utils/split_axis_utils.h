 * The split partitions the split axis between the two AIV lanes: lane L owns
 * ``[L * S, L * S + S)`` of it, where ``S`` is this stride. Two partitions are
 * possible, and they differ only when the boundary tile is ragged:
 *
 * | Partition | ``S`` | Lane extents for a `[16, ...]` box valid to 13 |
 * | --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
 * | box (default) | ``ceil(box / 2)`` = 8 | 8 and 5 |
 * | valid (this)  | ``ceil(V / 2)`` = 7   | 7 and 6 |
 *
 * The box partition is universal — it works for every tile in the region
 * whatever its valid extent — but pto-isa can only place lane 1's FIFO band at
 * its own extent (even codes) or one past it (odd codes), so lanes 8 and 5 have
 * no expressible transport. Balancing the VALID region instead makes the two
 * lanes differ by at most one by construction, which is exactly what the codes
 * express — and it splits the real work evenly rather than leaving lane 1 the
 * remainder.
 *
 * It is only sound when the whole body agrees on one logical row space, so this
 * returns null (keep the box partition) unless:
 *
 * - the body has at least one Cube -> Vector boundary and they all agree on the
 *   same static ``(box, valid)`` on the split axis;
 * - no Vector -> Cube boundary is present (the gather re-joins the lanes
 *   positionally at their own extents, which only abut when they are equal);
 * - every other split-axis tile in the body is derived from that boundary — a
 *   tile with an independent origin (a `tile.load`, a generator) spans the FULL
 *   box, which the balanced partition would not cover.

/**
 * @brief The pto-isa split code a Cube -> Vector boundary op must carry.
 *
 * pto-isa derives lane 1's band inside the FIFO slot from the popped tile's own
 * RUNTIME valid extents, so the code has to state how the two lanes' extents
 * relate (a2a3/a5 ``TPush.hpp popVecTileFromGMFiFo``):
 *
 * | Code                    | lane 1's band starts at | requires   |
 * | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
 * | ``kSplitUpDown`` / LR    | ``e1 * pitch``          | ``e0 == e1`` |
 * | ``kSplitUpDownOdd`` / LR | ``(e1 + 1) * pitch``    | ``e0 == e1 + 1`` |
 *
 * where ``eL = clamp(V - L * half, 0, half)`` is lane L's extent, ``V`` the
 * boundary tile's valid split-axis extent and ``half = ceil(box / 2)`` — the
 * same clamp the halving materializes into the popped tile's valid_shape.
 *
 * That covers both odd shapes: an odd physical box (``V == box == 2k + 1`` gives
 * ``k + 1`` / ``k``) and an odd valid extent inside an even box (``V == box - 1``
 * gives ``half`` / ``half - 1``). An empty lane 1 (``e1 == 0``, i.e.
 * ``V <= half``) reads nothing wherever it is pointed, so it keeps the even
 * code. Any other ragged extent has no expressible band pair and is rejected
 * with an actionable message rather than silently popping the wrong rows.
 *
 * A dynamic (non-ConstInt) box or valid extent has no compile-time lane extents,
 * so no code can be verified against them. It keeps the even code, which is exact
 * only when the boundary tile also declares the full split-axis box: the producer
 * transports that box, so lane 1's band sits at the box half and the even code
 * points there whatever the extent turns out to be. LocalizeExplicitBoundaryValid
 * establishes that pairing for a ``pl.split_aiv`` region (WithFullSplitAxisValid)
 * and moves the lane's own extent onto the boundary's consumers. A hand-written

/**
 * @brief Give each explicit-boundary ``tile.aiv_shard`` its TRUE per-lane valid
 *        extent on the split axis, and carry that extent to its consumers.
 *
 * ``ReshapeSplitAxis`` (the op deducer) can only halve the split-axis valid
 * extent with a ceil-div, because the lane index is not part of an op's type
 * function. When the operand's split-axis extent does not cover its physical
 * box, that guess is wrong for BOTH lanes: lane L holds
 * ``clamp(V - L * half, 0, half)``, so a ``[16, 256]`` accumulator valid to 5
 * rows must give lane 0 five rows and lane 1 none, not ``ceil(5 / 2) = 3`` each.
 *
 * A ``pl.split_aiv`` region body is the one place that guess can be repaired:
 * the region's own ``aiv_id = tile.get_subblock_idx()`` binding is in scope, so
 * the per-lane extent is materializable as an expression. The extent is then
 * propagated to every consumer that passes it through unchanged, because the
 * store is what finally reads it — and PTOAS offers no way to re-narrow a popped
 * tile after the fact (``pto.set_validshape`` needs a locally bound source,
 * which a frontend tpop result is not).
 *
 * Only the split axis is touched, and only when the operand is genuinely
 * partial there; a fully-valid operand keeps the deducer's exact ``half``.
 * A consumer that TRANSFORMS the extent (a reduction, a slice) rather than
 * passing it through is reported as a user-facing limitation with its span.
 *
 * The walk descends into nested control flow, so a shard / consumer / store
 * inside a loop or a branch is repaired exactly like a top-level one.
 *
 * @param stmts The region body statements (already half-width).
 * @param split_dim The partitioned tile dimension (see SplitDimension).
 * @param region_span Span of the enclosing region, for diagnostics.
 * @return The rewritten statement list (input order preserved).
