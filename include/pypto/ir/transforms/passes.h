 * loop; a non-divisor aligned K tail is peeled into a final
 * ``tile.matmul_acc``.
 *
 * L0C legality uses the backend's physical accumulator-row alignment, which
 * may be stricter than the logical cube shape (for example, an INT32 M=16
 * result occupies 32 rows on Ascend910B).  When that physical ``[M, N]``
 * footprint exceeds L0c, fresh ``tile.matmul`` and ``tile.matmul_bias`` calls
 * are M/N-tiled.  A result consumed by one output store uses direct-to-GM
 * placement; a result consumed entirely as a later matmul operand is assembled
 * into an on-chip Mat scratch.  The Mat-scratch route also folds a compatible
 * f32-to-bf16/f16
 * ``tile.cast(mode="rint")`` into the FIXPIPE writeback.
 *
 * The canonical frontend split-K form -- a full-output accumulator placeholder,
 * a pipeline carrying it through ``tile.matmul`` / ``tile.matmul_acc``, then
 * one store -- is M/N-tiled at the enclosing-loop level.  Each output sub-tile
 * completes the whole source K reduction before the next sub-tile starts, so
 * an oversized full Acc is never materialized.  Arbitrary standalone
 * ``tile.matmul_acc`` calls with caller-owned accumulators remain deferred with
 * ``PH-AT-006``.
 *
 * Full-K M/N grids may use output-, A-, or B-stationary loop orders.  L0C
 * double-buffering is enabled automatically under DSA_RP and PTOAS and is an
 * opt-in under the legacy PYPTO planner.  Under PYPTO, chained Mat-scratch
 * producers remain output-stationary to avoid the allocator offset-packing
 * limitation tracked by issue #1908; some dbC-enabled layouts can still exceed
 * operand capacity there.
 * DSA_RP and PTOAS retain operand-stationary choices because their lifetime-aware
 * placement can subdivide the released operand range.
 *
 * The pass also recognizes a user-authored, static pipeline (stage >= 2, trip
 * count divisible by the stage count) containing exactly one already-L0
 * ``tile.matmul``.  Its selected moving operand must be produced by a direct
 * per-iteration Mat-to-L0 transfer, while the other operand is loop-invariant.
 * Its Acc result must have one canonical loop-carried drain: direct-to-GM
 * ``tile.store`` needs at least four iterations; Acc-to-Mat ``tile.assemble``
 * needs at least eight iterations and an aligned Acc tile occupying at least
 * one quarter of L0C.  When the
 * conservative whole-function Acc footprint (including the physical stage
 * multiplicity of other pipelined Acc producers) plus one slot per profitable
 * loop fits in L0C, it enables the existing two-accumulator drain-overlap
 * schedule automatically under the PyPTO memory planner.  Deeper operand
 * pipelines are scheduled in depth-two compute/drain chunks and still rotate
 * only two L0C slots.  Explicit loop policies, nested control flow, multiple
 * cube matmuls or Acc values, non-canonical drain/yield chains, additional
 * stores, and insufficient L0C capacity stay unchanged.
 *
 * Eligible calls require static 2D operands with B in Mat and A in Mat or Vec.
 * ``tile.matmul_bias`` is supported when both matrix operands are Mat and its
 * static ``[1, N]`` bias is Mat- or Bias-resident and has the accumulator dtype
 * (FP32 for floating-point matrix operands, INT32 for integer operands). The
 * bias is applied once on the first K block. M/N tiling requires a full
 * rectangular ``[1, N]`` defining load (physical shape equals valid shape),
 * reconstructs each N window from that single-use ``tile.load`` when it is
 * separated from the call only by other sibling loads, then moves that
 * independent Mat tile to Bias;
 * candidate N is bounded by the
 * backend's bias-table capacity and its emitted pipeline replication depth.
 * An already-Bias-resident source stays outside the emitted grid and consumes
 * one slot rather than inheriting those replication factors.
 * The backend must support the exact Mat-to-Bias dtype pair, and matrix tile
 * dimensions must satisfy their layout-derived boxed alignment.
 * A manually materialized Left/Right operand is otherwise left untouched, but
 * if its static physical footprint alone exceeds L0A/L0B the pass raises an
 * operation-specific error with the operand name, required/available bytes,
 * source location, and both automatic- and manual-tiling fixes.
 * When the chooser returns the full ``(M, N, K)`` shape, no tiling rewrite is
 * needed, although a chained result may still be remapped to Mat by the
 * compatible cast-fold placement above.  Other unsupported regimes are left
 * untouched; useful deferred cases emit ``PerfHint`` diagnostics.
 * An already-Bias-resident source that itself needs N tiling is deferred
 * because Bias-to-Bias sub-window extraction is unsupported. A Mat source that
 * needs N tiling is also deferred unless it is a single-use 2D load in the same
 * statement scope with only sibling loads between it and the matmul, since
 * reloading across an intervening effect changes snapshot semantics and boxed
