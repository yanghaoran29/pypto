 * only describe an origin-anchored box, so not every source region survives the
 * repartition, and the ones that do not are rejected rather than rounded up.

 * 1. source fully valid                  -> new_shape
 * 2. source provably empty               -> all-zero box

 * 4. target cuts the buffer the same way -> box under new_shape
 * 5. otherwise                           -> reject
 * ```
 *
 * Cases 2 and 3 are exact because neither repartitions data: the empty set stays
 * empty under every reshape, and inserting or removing a provably-full physical
 * unit axis is a coordinate-only rank change that preserves an arbitrary
 * rectangle. Case 4 is the general rule, and for a static region it is *exact*:
 * it accepts a region if and only if some box under @p new_shape denotes the
 * very same flat cells. Tensor and tile reshape share this rule.
 *
 * Case 4 reads the region as the runs of elements it fills. Neighbouring source
 * axes belong to one run while the lower one is fully valid or the upper one is
 * pinned to a single coordinate; anywhere else the upper axis's stride survives
 * into the region and cuts it. Each run holds a flat prefix of its own volume,
 * so the region maps exactly when @p new_shape groups its own dimensions into
 * the same runs and each run's prefix falls on a dimension boundary there. A
 * flat prefix of the whole buffer is the one-run case; ``[2, 2, 2]`` valid
 * ``[2, 1, 2]`` is the two-run case ``2 | 4``, which ``[2, 4]`` spells as valid
 * ``[2, 2]`` and ``[8]`` cannot spell at all.
 *
 * Case 4 is the only one that reasons about flat positions, so it is the only
 * one that depends on storage order. Pass @p row_major_contiguous false for a
 * source whose elements are not laid out row-major (a ``col_major`` tile, a
 * ``DN`` / ``NZ`` tensor) and a partial region that needs case 4 is rejected
 * rather than mapped against the wrong flat order. Cases 1-3 relabel axes
 * without consulting flat positions and hold under any layout.
 *
 * A symbolic extent narrows what case 4 can prove, but does not by itself
 * reject: *any* run may carry a symbolic **valid** extent through unchanged,
 * onto a target dimension of its own run whose step is exactly that run's
 * trailing volume. What has to be static is the **physical** geometry the region
 * is measured against -- the target extents, the extents below each run's free
 * axis, the free axis itself on the symbolic path (its dimension has to be

/**
 * @brief Derive the valid region left behind by a write, when it is representable
 *
 * A valid shape names one origin-anchored rectangle, so the region after a write
 * is expressible only when the union of the target's rectangle and the written
 * one is itself an origin-anchored rectangle. The bounding candidate is
 *
 * ```text
 * out_valid[i] = min(shape[i], max(target_valid[i], offset[i] + source_valid[i]))
 * ```
 *
 * and this returns it only where that union is *provably* exactly that rectangle.
 *
 * **Why the proof is needed.** Returning the target's full shape after a partial
 * write lets a later store push padding out as real data; returning only the
 * source discards real data the target already held. Both are silent. Writing
 * `W = ∏[o[i], o[i]+s[i])` into `T = ∏[0, t[i])`, the candidate rectangle covers
 * `T ∪ W` exactly in these cases, which are what this accepts:
 *
 * - the written region is empty — the write is a no-op and the target stands;
 * - the target is empty — the result is the source, provided it sits at the origin;
 * - the written region lies inside the target — the target stands (a fully valid
 *   target is this case, so it stays fully valid);
 * - the target lies inside an origin-anchored written region — the source stands;
 * - the write grows exactly one dimension `d` and abuts what is already there
 *   (`offset[d] <= target_valid[d]`, so no gap opens), while every other dimension
 *   spans the target exactly (`offset[i] == 0` and `source_valid[i] == target_valid[i]`).
 *   Anything less on a passenger dimension leaves the new slab narrower than the
 *   region it extends — an L-shape, which no valid shape can name.
 *
 * Growth in two or more dimensions at once, a gap, a mismatched passenger
 * dimension, and any of these relations left unproven all reject rather than
 * widen. Extents are compared with the tri-state proof vocabulary, so symbolic
 * appends stated by structural equality (`t = [k, 128]`, `s = [m, 128]` at
 * `[k, 0]` yields `[k + m, 128]`) are accepted while unrelated symbols are not.
 *
 * Expressions are built through the same proof-first helpers the window-read rule
 * uses, so constant arithmetic folds and no redundant ``min`` / ``max`` nesting
 * reaches a type.

 * the *valid* row count of the L0A operand (pto-isa `TMatmul.hpp`:
 * `uint16_t m = aMatrix.GetValidRow()`). Every Acc reader instead derives its stride from the
 * tile's compile-time physical `Rows` unless the tile is compact, in which case it recomputes
 * ceil(validRow/16)*16 — exactly the stride `mad` wrote at (`tstore_common.hpp`,
 * `TStoreAccNz2nd` and siblings). A narrowed accumulator that is not compact is therefore read
 * back at a different pitch than it was written at, silently scrambling every N-fractal above
 * the first (issue #2470). This mirrors the L0A/L0B stamping `tile.extract` gained for #2232.
 *

 * alone, so a narrowed *column* extent leaves writer and reader in agreement and keeps the
 * historical non-compact form.
