//   | op / value                 | inside a region | outside a region             |

//   | aiv_shard / aic_gather     | the boundary    | ERROR — check (c)            |
//
// and every tile value that crosses a region edge must say so with a boundary
// op — checks (f) (V->C) and (g) (C->V). That is what manual mode buys: the
// author, not the compiler, owns the AIC/AIV boundary, so the boundary is
// written down.
//
// A function with NO region keeps the pre-manual-mode behaviour untouched.
//
// Checks performed:
//   (a) No cube compute inside a region — for two independent reasons, so the
//       check fires in EVERY region regardless of mode. In a data-parallel
//       region each AIV lane holds only half the tile, so a cube op cannot be
//       vector-split; and in ANY region (task-parallel included) the region IS
//       the AIV lane's body, so cube work does not belong in it at all.
//   (b) No AIV reduce that collapses the split axis inside a region — that
//       produces a partial per-lane reduction (a miscompile). Unlike (a), this
//       reasoning really is split-axis-specific, so (b) stays gated on the
//       data-parallel modes (a NONE region has no split axis to collapse).
//   (c) tile.aiv_shard / tile.aic_gather (the AIV-split boundary) must appear
//       inside a region, never at top level. They are ACCEPTED in a
//       task-parallel (SplitMode::None) region: there they mean "this value
//       crosses the AIC/AIV boundary" without splitting it (the deducer is
//       shape-preserving at split=0 — see cross_core.cpp), which is exactly what
//       checks (f)/(g) require an author to write there.
//   (d) The boundary memory contract: tile.aiv_shard is Acc -> Vec and
//       tile.aic_gather is Vec -> Mat (see cross_core.cpp). Both ops ARE the
//       cross-core transfer, so the operand must live on the PRODUCING lane and
//       the result on the CONSUMING one. Mode-independent — a task-parallel
//       crossing spans the same two lanes as a data-parallel one — so it runs in
//       every region. Each side is skipped until its memory space is resolved,
//       so the check is inert at the OutlineIncoreScopes verification point
//       (where the boundary is still the space-less `tensor.*` form) and live
//       from ConvertTensorToTileOps onwards — which is why both that pass and
//       InferTileMemorySpace re-produce this property (see pass_properties.h);
//       without that, (d) would never run.
//   (e) No VECTOR-affine compute outside every region, in a function that holds
//       at least one region. With the region authoritative for placement, such
//       an op has no defined home: it is neither pinned to the AIV lane by a
//       region nor cube work. tile.load / tile.store are carved out — they are
//       NOT an authoring escape hatch but the COMPILER's own output:
//       ConvertTensorToTileOps materializes the load/store pair for a
//       tensor-level op OUTSIDE the region even when the compute it feeds was
//       written inside one (a `pl.exp(gm_tensor)` in a region becomes a hoisted
//       tile.load plus an in-region tile.exp). Without the carve-out the check
//       fires on IR the compiler itself produced.
//   (f) V->C: a value DEFINED inside a region and consumed by a CUBE-lane op
//       OUTSIDE it must be the result of a tile.aic_gather.
//   (g) C->V: a CUBE-produced value defined OUTSIDE every region and consumed by
//       a VECTOR-lane op INSIDE one must reach it through a tile.aiv_shard.
//   (i) A pl.aiv_shard / pl.aic_gather result must not cross a loop back-edge —
//       neither as a loop iter_arg's init value nor as the value yielded back
//       into one. The half-width property is not tracked through a loop phi:
//       LowerAutoVectorSplit's scan sees the IterArg rather than the shard that
//       defined it and reports an already-halved tile as full width, while
//       ExpandMixedKernel folds the boundary into a tpop and then
//       FixupIterArgInitValues — which runs before the DeepClone that would
//       substitute it — reads the original init var as undefined and resurrects
//       the very op that was just folded away. Both ends are checked: the loop
//       type-checks either way, so a body seeded with a half-shaped tile.full and
//       fed by a shard from iteration 1 onwards defeats the same passes with no
//       init-side signal.
//   (j) A boundary result must be consumed in the region that produced it, when
//       the consuming region is DATA-PARALLEL. Both paths such a region can take
//       mishandle one from elsewhere: with no boundary op of its own it halves
//       every tile it computes along the split axis and localizes every store
//       offset to the lane, so an already-per-lane value is halved twice and
//       offset twice; with one, nothing is re-halved but AnalyzeSplitBody is
//       seeded per REGION, so the incoming value is misjudged as full width. A
//       mode=NONE region takes neither path and is exempt — that carve-out is
//       what keeps the cross-core comm-kernel shape (shard in one region, consume
//       in a NONE one) legal, and it is why (j) is gated rather than universal.
//       Keyed on the DEFINITION being a boundary op, not on the value being
//       per-lane: a per-lane value one op removed from the boundary is legal and

//   (k) A function must not mix a no-split crossing with a split one. Every
//       pl.aiv_shard / pl.aic_gather in one function rides ONE logical
//       cross-core pipe -- BuildAutomaticPipeSetup emits a single
//       initialize_pipe per side, with a combined dir_mask, so both directions
//       share it too -- and pto-isa bakes split-vs-no-split into that pipe's
//       TYPE (the IsNoSplit parameter of TPipe<...>), not into each transfer.
//       One pipe therefore runs the no-split protocol or the split one for its
//       whole lifetime, and PTOAS rejects the mix at
//       'pto.initialize_l2g2l_pipe', naming an internal op the author never
//       wrote. The split AXIS is genuinely per-transfer (TALLOC / TPUSH / TPOP
//       take TileSplitAxis as their own template argument), so UP_DOWN beside
//       LEFT_RIGHT shares one pipe and is NOT rejected -- the split is between
//       SplitMode::None and everything else, exactly as PTOAS partitions it.
//       Reported once per function, on the later of the two offending ops.
//
// (f) and (g) are the point of manual mode. BOTH crossings already lower without
// them: the compiler happily emits tpush/tpop(split=0) for an implicit crossing
// in either direction, and did so before these checks existed. What it cannot do
// is decide, on the author's behalf, WHERE the AIC/AIV boundary belongs — and a
// boundary the author did not write is a boundary the author did not think
// about. In manual mode the crossing is therefore spelled out or it is an error.
// The `tile.load` / `tile.store` carve-out from (e) applies to both roles here
// (definer and consumer) for the same reason and with the same weight: the
// compiler hoists them out of the region itself, so without the carve-out (f)
// and (g) fire on the compiler's own output rather than on anything an author
// wrote.
//
// Both are keyed on operand/result MEMORY SPACES (via core_affinity), so like
// (d) they are inert until those are resolved: at the OutlineIncoreScopes
// verification point a `tensor.matmul` classifies SHARED and neither check has
// anything to say. They come alive at the ConvertTensorToTileOps and
// InferTileMemorySpace verification points, which is early enough to reject the
// program long before the boundary is folded into tpush/tpop.
//
// NOT CHECKED, DELIBERATELY: "a once-only side effect (pld.system.notify) sits
// outside every region in a mixed kernel". Such a check was written and then
// removed, because it cannot deliver the guarantee its diagnostic would
// promise. Pinning the op to the AIV lane (which the pass 23 placement stamp
// does, and which is kept) removes the CUBE-lane copy — but the AIV function
// carries `dual_aiv_dispatch`, so its body still runs on BOTH AIV sub-lanes.
// An un-sharded notify therefore lands twice whether or not it is in a region,
// and a region cannot be made to mean "once". Worse, the correct authoring form
// — sharding the work by `aiv_id` so each lane notifies DIFFERENT peers — and
// the incorrect one — both lanes notifying the SAME peer — compile to the very
// same single statement in the AIV body; they differ only in whether `aiv_id`
// reaches the call's arguments, which no robust structural check can tell apart
// (any dataflow approximation false-negatives the moment the index goes through
// arithmetic). The rule is therefore stated for authors in
// docs/en/user/language/04-scopes.md and the `pl.split_aiv` docstring, and left
// unenforced. ExpandMixedKernel consumes lexical regions to keep their
// no-duplicate SHARED calls off the cube lane.
//
// The checked ops (matmul, reduces, aiv_shard/aic_gather, vector compute) are
// always plain Calls with a non-null op_; Submits carry a GlobalVar callee and
// no op_, so no SubmitPtr override is needed (see pass-submit-awareness.md).
