PyPTO IR module with tensor operations.

This module provides:
- Re-exports of all core IR types from pypto_core.ir
- Organized operation namespaces (e.g., op.tensor.create)
- IR Builder for incremental IR construction
- Helper utilities
- Enhanced type constructors (e.g., TensorType with integer shape support)

# Import operation modules
# Import operator overloading with span capture and normalization
# This patches Var and ScalarExpr with Python operators

    Print IR node or Type object in Python IR syntax.

    This is a unified wrapper that dispatches to the appropriate C++ function

        prefix: Module prefix (default 'pi' for 'import pypto.ir as pi')

    Returns:
