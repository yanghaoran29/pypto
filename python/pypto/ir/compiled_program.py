"""Compiled program wrapper returned by :func:`ir.compile`.

Provides a Triton-like callable API: compile once, then call with
torch tensors::

    compiled = ir.compile(MyProgram)
    compiled(a, b, c)                    # in-place on default sim, device 0
    c = compiled(a, b)                   # return style
    compiled(a, b, c, device=1)          # specify device at call time

**Why the ``pypto.runtime`` imports are function-local.** This module is both
the compilation artifact and the execution handle, so it reaches forward into
the layer below it. Each deferral has its own reason, and they are not the same:

- ``device_runner`` needs the optional ``simpler`` package at import time.
  Hoisting it would make ``simpler`` a hard requirement of ``import pypto.ir``,
  which the unit-test runners do not have.
- ``runner``, ``debug.run_script_writer`` and (in the L3 sibling)
  ``distributed_runner`` import cleanly at module scope; they stay deferred to
  keep ``pypto.ir``'s own import graph free of the dispatch layer, not because
  hoisting them fails.

The one import that genuinely could not be hoisted was the metadata the replay
writer reads back — that cycle is gone: it lives in the ``param_info`` leaf now.

        That declaration is what makes recompiling into a reused ``output_dir``

        left by an earlier multi-orch compile of a *different* program outlives it;

        ``None`` means the caller declared no layout (a direct construction outside

        calling a sub-callable without ``kernel_config.py`` then fails cleanly

        builds are excluded: they also lay out ``next_levels/<chip_task>/`` but
