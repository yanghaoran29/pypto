"""Reserved ``Function.attrs`` keys shared between the DSL, the backend and the JIT.

Every key here is also declared in C++ as an ``inline constexpr const char*`` in
``include/pypto/ir/function.h``, which carries the authoritative lifecycle
documentation for each one (which pass writes it, which reads it, whether it is
ever stripped). This module is the Python half of the same pair so a rename has
one place to change per layer instead of one place per call site.

``tests/lint/check_function_attr_key_parity.py`` fails when the two halves
disagree, so a key added or renamed on one side cannot silently drift from the
other.
