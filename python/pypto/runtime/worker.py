"""L2 :class:`ChipWorker` — the single-chip concrete runtime handle.

Inside a ``with ChipWorker(...) as _:`` block, calls to ``CompiledProgram(...)``
reuse the active worker instead of creating a fresh one. Outside such a block,
behavior is unchanged from one-shot construction in
:func:`pypto.runtime.device_runner._execute_on_device`.

For explicit dispatch (no ``ContextVar`` discovery), call
:meth:`ChipWorker.run` directly, or pre-register with :meth:`ChipWorker.register`
and call the returned :class:`RegistrationHandle`.

Example — implicit reuse::

    from pypto.runtime import ChipWorker, RunConfig

    with ChipWorker(config=RunConfig(platform="a2a3")):
        out1 = Add(*tensors1)   # uses active ChipWorker
        out2 = Mul(*tensors2)   # reuses same ChipWorker
    # close() runs once on exit

Example — explicit dispatch::

    w = ChipWorker(config=RunConfig(platform="a2a3"))
    try:
        out = w.run(compiled_add, a, b)
        h = w.register(compiled_mul)        # pre-register hot path
        for _ in range(1000):
            h(a, b, out)
    finally:
        w.close()

class ChipWorker(Worker):
    """L2 single-chip execution handle, bound to one ``(platform, device_id, runtime)``.

    A ``ChipWorker`` auto-initializes device state in ``__init__`` so that an
    immediate ``with chipworker:`` block can dispatch runs without further
    setup. Construction without entering a ``with`` block also works — call
    :meth:`close` manually when done, or re-enter via ``with`` later.

    Inside a ``with`` block, ``CompiledProgram.__call__`` finds this worker via
    a ``ContextVar`` and reuses its initialized device context instead of
    creating a fresh worker per call.
    Reuse only happens when all four binding fields match and the worker has
    every capability required by the artifact — otherwise the caller either
    falls through to the one-shot path (binding mismatch) or raises (capability
    mismatch on the same device).

    .. note::
       Distinct from ``simpler.worker.ChipWorker`` (the C++ L2 backend handle
       that this class wraps internally via ``self._impl``). pypto users
       interact only with this class; the simpler C++ name is not re-exported
       through ``pypto.runtime.task_interface``.

    Args:
        config: Run configuration providing ``platform`` and ``device_id``.
            Defaults to :class:`RunConfig` defaults.
        level: Hierarchy level. Only ``2`` (single-chip) is currently
            supported on ``ChipWorker``; pass ``level=2`` explicitly or rely
            on the default. L3+ goes through
            :class:`~pypto.runtime.distributed_runner.DistributedWorker`.
        runtime: Runtime implementation name. Must match the runtime the
            program is compiled against; otherwise reuse silently falls
            through to the one-shot path. Defaults to
            ``"tensormap_and_ringbuffer"``.
        enable_sdma: Whether the underlying runtime worker provisions the SDMA
            workspace required by prefetch artifacts. Defaults to ``False``.
        auto_init: If ``True``, call :meth:`init` from ``__init__``. Default
            is ``True``.

    underlying cid. :meth:`unregister` only marks the handle closed; it does
    NOT call ``simpler.Worker.unregister``. Real cid release happens once,
    in :meth:`Worker.close`. ``cid`` is informational only.

    **L3 note:** ``DistributedWorker`` doesn't expose a per-callable cid the
    way ChipWorker does (its chip / sub registrations are baked at prepare()
    time). For L3 handles, ``cid`` is ``0``; the dispatch path still routes
    through the orchestrator via ``DistributedWorker.run``.
