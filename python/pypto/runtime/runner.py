"""
PyPTO runtime runner.

Provides :class:`RunConfig` — the settings that drive a run — and the
dispatch implementation that puts an already-compiled artifact directory
onto an Ascend NPU (or simulator). The supported way in is
:meth:`pypto.ir.CompiledProgram.from_dir`; the module-level
:func:`execute_compiled` is a deprecated wrapper over the same code.

Compilation is :func:`pypto.ir.compile`'s job; nothing here compiles for you.
:meth:`RunConfig.compile_kwargs` carries the compile-side settings across::

    import torch
    from pypto import ir
    from pypto.runtime import RunConfig

    config = RunConfig(platform="a2a3sim")
    compiled = ir.compile(MyProgram, **config.compile_kwargs())

    a = torch.full((128, 128), 2.0)
    b = torch.full((128, 128), 3.0)
    c = torch.zeros(128, 128)
    compiled(a, b, c, config=config)

@dataclass(kw_only=True)
class RunConfig:
    """Configuration for compiling and dispatching a program.

    Carries both halves: :meth:`compile_kwargs` extracts the compile-side
    fields for :func:`pypto.ir.compile`, and the rest is read at dispatch by
    :meth:`~pypto.ir.CompiledProgram.__call__` / :meth:`Worker.run`.

    When passed to :meth:`pypto.jit.decorator.JITFunction.lower`, only
    ``platform``, ``strategy``, diagnostics, dependency analysis, and
    ``memory_planner`` affect pass execution. Runtime and artifact fields such
    as ``device_id``, ``dump_passes``, ``dump_ptoas_passes``,
    ``save_kernels_dir``, and ``compile_profiling`` are ignored; ``lower()``
    does not execute or write compilation artifacts.

    Attributes:
        cache_config: Complete per-call persistent-cache policy. None uses process or environment defaults.
        arch: Target architecture, as the codegen backend that names it —
            ``BackendType.Ascend910B`` (a2a3) or ``BackendType.Ascend950`` (a5).
        execution_mode: :class:`ExecutionMode.SIM` or ``ONBOARD``.
        platform: **Not a field** — the wire spelling of the two axes above
            (``"a2a3sim"`` / ``"a2a3"`` / ``"a5sim"`` / ``"a5"``), derived on
            read. Accepted as a constructor keyword, where it sets both axes.
        device_id: Hardware device index (ignored for simulator).
        backend_type: **Not a field** — a read-only property derived from
            ``platform``. Accepted as a deprecated constructor keyword, which
            warns and is discarded when it contradicts the platform.
        rtol: Relative tolerance for result comparison.
        atol: Absolute tolerance for result comparison.
        strategy: PyPTO optimisation strategy applied during compilation.
        dump_passes: Per-pass IR dump control. A :class:`~pypto.ir.PassDumpLevel`
            (``NONE`` / ``CONCISE`` / ``EXPLICIT``) or a ``bool``
            (``True`` -> ``CONCISE``, ``False`` -> ``NONE``). ``EXPLICIT`` resolves
            implicit tile layouts and distributed window buffers in the dump.
        dump_ptoas_passes: If ``True``, dump full-module intermediate IR after
            every ptoas pass under
            ``<output_dir>/ptoas_passes/<codegen-unit>/``. Has no effect when
            ptoas is unavailable and compilation stops at raw ``.pto`` output.
        save_kernels: If ``True``, retain generated artefacts after execution.
            When ``False`` (default), a temporary directory is used and cleaned up.
        save_kernels_dir: Directory to save generated artefacts when *save_kernels*
            is ``True``.  If ``None``, a timestamped directory is created under
            ``build_output/<program_name>_<timestamp>``.
        codegen_only: If ``True``, stop after code generation without executing
            on device.  Useful for validating compilation output.
        enable_chip_swimlane: Chip swimlane collection **level** — per-task
            timing records written into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/chip_swimlane_records.json``. Mirrors the
            runtime harness's ``--enable-chip-swimlane PERF_LEVEL``; each level
            is a real guard in the runtime collectors, so a lower level never
            stamps the data a higher one does and no post-processing recovers
            it:

            * ``0`` / ``False`` — off.
            * ``1`` — AICore per-task start / end plus the task record buffer.
            * ``2`` — ``1`` plus AICPU-stamped dispatch / finish, which is what
              makes the ``[dispatch, start]`` pickup gap readable.
            * ``3`` — ``2`` plus scheduler main-loop phase records, required by
              ``python -m simpler_setup.tools.sched_overhead_analysis`` and by
              the PyPTO Toolkit plugin's Scheduler View.
            * ``4`` / ``True`` — ``3`` plus orchestrator phase records (the
              Toolkit plugin's AICPU Orchestrator view). ``True`` requests this
              full level, matching the runtime harness's bare
              ``--enable-chip-swimlane``.

            The former spelling ``enable_l2_swimlane`` still works (constructor
            keyword and attribute) but emits a ``DeprecationWarning``.

            On onboard platforms, ``swimlane_converter`` then produces
            ``merged_swimlane_*.json`` alongside the records. Because the converter joins
            the timing against a task graph that only ``deps.json`` carries,
            enabling this on an onboard platform runs the workload **twice**: a
            first dep_gen pass captures ``deps.json``, then a clean swimlane pass
            runs with dep_gen off because collection perturbs timing. L2 runs
            the graph pass in a subprocess so its device/SVM state is fully
            reclaimed before the timing pass (a failed capture is logged, not
            fatal). L3 one-shot uses separate Worker lifecycles; a prepared L3
            worker uses two ``Worker.run()`` fences and keeps resident handles
            alive. Both L3 passes execute the program without restoring mutable
            arguments between them. Simulator platforms (``*sim``) stay single-pass
            and only emit ``chip_swimlane_records.json`` — the merged swimlane file
            is intentionally skipped because the simulator does not yet ship the
            task metadata the converter needs. Mirrors runtime's
            ``CallConfig.enable_chip_swimlane`` field.
        enable_dump_args: Per-task argument dump **level** written into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/args_dump/``. Inspect with
            ``python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer``. Mirrors
            ``--dump-args``:

            * ``0`` / ``False`` — off (no dump).
            * ``1`` / ``True`` — **partial**: only the tensors marked via the
              DSL marker ``pl.dump_tag(t)`` (or ``pl.submit(..., dumps=[...])``).
            * ``2`` — **full**: every task's tensor inputs and outputs.

            Full dump on a large workload can saturate the host-side dump
            collector (~42 MB/s drain rate) and get the AICPU killed by a STARS
            op-execute timeout — prefer partial (level ``1``) plus
            ``pl.dump_tag(t)`` to limit dump to specific tensors
            (simpler#844 selective tensor dump).
        enable_pmu: AICore PMU event type. ``0`` disables collection;
            ``>0`` enables and selects the event (``2`` = PIPE_UTILIZATION,
            ``4`` = MEMORY — see ``runtime/docs/dfx/pmu-profiling.md``).
            Output: ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/pmu.csv``. Mirrors
            ``--enable-pmu N``.
        enable_dep_gen: Capture simpler dependency edges into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/deps.json``. Render to HTML on demand via
            ``python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer <deps.json> --format
            html`` (the CLI defaults to text output). Mirrors
            ``--enable-dep-gen``.
        enable_scope_stats: Capture per-scope heap / task_window / tensormap
            ring-fill peaks into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/scope_stats/scope_stats.jsonl``. Render to
            HTML on demand via ``runtime/tools/scope_stats_plot.py``. Mirrors
            ``--enable-scope-stats``.
        compile_profiling: If ``True``, enable compile profiling that records
            per-stage wall-clock timings (parse, passes, codegen).
            Results are written to ``report/pipeline_profile.{txt,json}`` in
            the output directory.
        diagnostic_phase: Override the diagnostic phase gate for compilation.
            ``None`` uses the default (``PrePipeline``, or ``PYPTO_WARNING_LEVEL``
            env var). Setting to ``None`` silences warnings AND performance hints;
            finer-grained control uses ``disabled_diagnostics``.
        disabled_diagnostics: Set of diagnostic checks to disable during
            compilation (covers warnings and perf hints). ``None`` uses the
            default (``UnusedControlFlowResult`` disabled, perf hints enabled).
        golden_data_dir: Target directory for ``.pt`` data files.  When set,
            the generated ``golden.py`` always loads tensors from this path.
            If the directory already contains all required ``.pt`` files they
            are reused; otherwise the directory is created and data is generated
            there.  Use a path from a previous run
            (e.g. ``build_output/<name>_<ts>/data``) to reuse existing golden
            data, or specify a new path to persist data to a fixed location.
        aicpu_thread_num: Optional per-invocation override of the AICPU
            thread count. ``None`` (default) defers to the value baked
            into ``kernel_config.py``'s ``RUNTIME_CONFIG`` at compile
            time (which itself may be unset, in which case the simpler
            runtime default applies).
        ring_task_window: Optional per-invocation override of the runtime
            ring's task-slot window (number of in-flight tasks). Forwarded to
            ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_task_window``. A scalar (broadcast to
            all scope-depth rings) or a list/tuple of exactly 4 ints sizing
            rings 0..3 independently; each entry must be a power of two ``>= 4`` (a
            ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its default). ``None`` (default)
            leaves the field unset so the runtime falls back to its
            compile-time default.
        ring_heap: Optional per-invocation override of the per-ring output-heap
            size in **bytes**. Forwarded to ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_heap``.
            A scalar or a list/tuple of 4 ints (per ring 0..3); each entry must
            be a power of two ``>= 1024`` (a ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its
            default). ``None`` defers to the runtime's compile-time default.
        ring_dep_pool: Optional per-invocation override of the per-ring
            dependency-edge pool capacity. Forwarded to
            ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_dep_pool``. A scalar or a list/tuple
            of 4 ints (per ring 0..3); each entry must be in ``[4, INT32_MAX]`` (a
            ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its default). ``None`` defers
            to the runtime's compile-time default.
        distributed_config: Optional L3 distributed-execution config, consumed
            only on the ``@pl.jit`` path. When set, it is forwarded to
            ``ir.compile()`` (via :meth:`RunConfig.compile_kwargs`)
            so a HOST-level ``@pl.jit.host`` kernel compiles to a
            :class:`~pypto.ir.distributed_compiled_program.DistributedCompiledProgram`
            and dispatches per-rank. ``None`` (default) compiles a regular
            single-chip :class:`~pypto.ir.compiled_program.CompiledProgram`.
            :meth:`compile_kwargs` forwards it too, so a ``@pl.program``
            compiled via ``ir.compile(prog, **config.compile_kwargs())`` picks
            up the same distributed target.
        analyze_auto_scopes_for_deps: If ``True``, enable compiler-derived task
            dependency analysis for AUTO runtime scopes during compilation.
            Defaults to ``False`` so existing runs keep using TensorMap fallback
            unless this behavior is explicitly requested.
        memory_planner: Who plans on-chip buffer memory —
            :attr:`~pypto.pypto_core.passes.MemoryPlanner.PYPTO` (PyPTO runs
            ``MemoryReuse`` + ``AllocateMemoryAddr`` and bakes physical
            addresses), ``DSA_RP`` (PyPTO runs its in-tree
            capacity-constrained DSA-RP planner), or ``PTOAS`` (the PyPTO
            allocation passes are skipped and ptoas ``PlanMemory`` owns reuse
            and addressing). ``None`` (default) defers to the active
            ``PassContext``, or to ``PYPTO`` when none is active.
            Forwarded to ``ir.compile()``, which rejects it when a
            ``PassContext`` is already active — set it on that context instead.

# old spelling stays usable for one release.
#
# The alias is deliberately **not** a dataclass field. ``dataclasses.replace()``
# re-supplies every field from the existing instance, so an alias field (or an
# ``InitVar``) would arrive alongside the canonical one on every ``replace``

# echoed the old value back". That ambiguity resolves either into spurious
# warnings or — worse — into ``replace(cfg, enable_chip_swimlane=N)`` being
# silently overridden by the stale alias. Keeping the alias off the field list
# leaves ``replace``, ``fields()``, ``asdict()`` and ``repr()`` clean, and routes
# the old name through an ``__init__`` wrapper plus a property instead.
#
# ``backend_type`` is off the field list for the same reason, plus one of its
# own. It is derived from ``platform``, so a caller-supplied value has never
# taken effect. As a field it would come back through ``replace()``:
# ``replace(cfg, platform="a5")`` re-supplies the *old* platform's backend, and

    The runtime swimlane converter joins per-task timing against a task graph
    that only ``deps.json`` (a dep_gen capture) carries — the device hot path no
    longer records per-task fanout. Because dep_gen collection perturbs timing,
    the graph and the clean timing must come from separate runs (the converter's
    documented "capture the graph once, time many times" workflow). So when
    swimlane is requested on an onboard platform we run:

      * Graph pass — dep_gen only, producing ``deps.json``. Run in a **separate
        subprocess** (*capture_deps*): the runtime's per-run finalize does not
        reliably reclaim the SVM host-register mappings the DFX collectors
        allocate, so a second DFX run in the same process hits the registration
        cap (``halHostRegister`` rc 8). A child process fully reclaims that
        state on exit. Best-effort — a failed capture is logged, not fatal.
      * Timing pass — swimlane (plus any other timing DFX), dep_gen off,
        producing the clean ``chip_swimlane_records.json``. Runs in-process.

    Both passes write into the same ``output_prefix`` (the subprocess is pointed
    at the same ``dfx_outputs/``), so the converter finds ``deps.json`` and the
    records side by side.

    Simulator platforms (``*sim``) stay single-pass: swimlane conversion is
    skipped there anyway (the simulator does not ship the task metadata the
    converter needs), so a second run buys nothing.

    Args:
        run_pass: Executes one in-process device run with the given DFX flags.

        dfx: Runtime DFX toggles. When any flag is enabled the artefacts

        aicpu_thread_num: Optional override of the AICPU thread count.
            When ``None`` (default), the value baked into

            Accepted here so callers that reuse one config dictionary for
            compile and execute can pass it through safely. It has no effect

    the DFX toggles and ``aicpu_thread_num`` are already ``RunConfig`` fields,
    read fresh on every dispatch. ``from_dir(platform=...)`` still decides the
    platform for a call made *without* a config.

    Emits a :class:`DeprecationWarning` and forwards to the same implementation
    the artifact path uses. Behaviour of this function is unchanged; only the
    name is going away.
