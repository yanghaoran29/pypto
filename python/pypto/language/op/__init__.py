"""
PyPTO Language operations module.

This module organizes language-level operations by category:
- tensor: High-level tensor operations (TensorType)
- block: Block-level tile operations (TileType)
- system: Hardware synchronization primitives

A unified namespace (``pl.add``, ``pl.exp``, ...) auto-dispatches
between tensor and block paths based on the input type (Tensor vs Tile).
The explicit ``pl.tensor.*``, ``pl.block.*``, and ``pl.system.*``
namespaces remain available for cases where the caller wants to be explicit.
