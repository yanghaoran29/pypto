# Runtime DFX (Design For X) Flags

PyPTO exposes Simpler's four runtime diagnostic sub-features as independent
toggles on [`RunConfig`](../../../python/pypto/runtime/runner.py). Each
toggle maps 1:1 to a field on Simpler's `CallConfig` and to the matching
flag in `runtime/conftest.py`, so the two surfaces stay aligned.

## Flag matrix

| `RunConfig` field | pytest flag | `CallConfig` member | Artefact under `dfx_outputs/` | Post-run converter |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `enable_l2_swimlane: bool` | `--enable-l2-swimlane` | `enable_l2_swimlane` | `l2_swimlane_records.json` | `swimlane_converter` → `merged_swimlane_*.json` |
| `enable_dump_tensor: bool` | `--dump-tensor` | `enable_dump_tensor` | `tensor_dump/{tensor_dump.json,bin}` | `dump_viewer` (manual) |
| `enable_pmu: int` | `--enable-pmu [N]` (bare = `2`) | `enable_pmu` (`0` off, `>0` event type) | `pmu.csv` | — |
| `enable_dep_gen: bool` | `--enable-dep-gen` | `enable_dep_gen` | `deps.json` | `deps_to_graph` (manual) |

The four flags are **fully independent** and may be combined in any
subset. Enabling *any* of them auto-forces `RunConfig.save_kernels=True`
so the `<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/` directory survives the run.

## Output contract

The runtime writes every artefact under a single directory passed via
`CallConfig.output_prefix`. PyPTO sets that prefix to
`<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/` and the constituent subpaths are fixed per the
table above. Simpler's `CallConfig::validate()` rejects the call if any
flag is enabled but `output_prefix` is empty; PyPTO mirrors that contract
on the Python side and raises `ValueError` from `execute_on_device`
*before* the C++ boundary so the failure traceback points at the
caller.

## Usage

### From Python (`RunConfig`)

```python
from pypto.runtime import run, RunConfig

run(
    MyProgram, a, b, c,
    config=RunConfig(
        platform="a2a3sim",
        enable_l2_swimlane=True,     # produces l2_swimlane_records.json
        enable_dep_gen=True,         # produces deps.json (render with deps_to_graph on demand)
        enable_pmu=4,                # PMU event = MEMORY
    ),
)
```

### From pytest

```bash
pytest tests/st/runtime/framework_and_models/test_perf_swimlane.py \
    --platform a2a3sim --enable-l2-swimlane

pytest tests/st/runtime/ \
    --platform a2a3sim --enable-l2-swimlane --enable-dep-gen
```

## Rendering `deps.json` to HTML

`enable_dep_gen` only emits the raw `deps.json`; the HTML pan/zoom graph
is produced by a separate offline tool. The tool is **not** invoked
automatically — Graphviz layout on a multi-thousand-node graph can run
for many minutes and, when launched on the runner's hot path, has
caused outer schedulers (e.g. taskqueue daemons) to SIGKILL the entire
job tree. Render on demand instead:

```bash
# Default — Graphviz `dot` engine, hierarchical layout (<500 nodes).
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_to_graph <work_dir>/dfx_outputs/deps.json

# Large graphs — switch to the scalable force-directed engine.
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_to_graph <work_dir>/dfx_outputs/deps.json \
    --engine sfdp
```

The output is written next to the input as `deps_graph.html` (override
with `-o <path>`). Supported `--engine` values, mirroring Graphviz:
`dot | sfdp | fdp | neato | circo | twopi`. `dot` is the default and
gives the cleanest DAG-style layout up to ~500 nodes; for larger graphs
prefer `sfdp` (O(N log N) layout, scales to 10k+ nodes). The runner
prints this same hint at the end of every dep_gen-enabled run.

Requires Graphviz on `PATH` (`apt install graphviz` /
`brew install graphviz`). Open the resulting HTML in any browser —
drag to pan, wheel to zoom, `f` to fit, `r` to reset.

## Implementation map

| Concern | File | Function / member |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| `RunConfig` field declarations | [runner.py](../../../python/pypto/runtime/runner.py) | `RunConfig` dataclass + `any_dfx_enabled()` |
| `CallConfig` plumbing | [device_runner.py](../../../python/pypto/runtime/device_runner.py) | `execute_on_device(..., enable_*, output_prefix)` |
| Pipeline bundle | [runner.py](../../../python/pypto/runtime/runner.py) | `_DfxOpts` dataclass + `_DfxOpts.from_run_config` |
| Per-flag post-run dispatch | [runner.py](../../../python/pypto/runtime/runner.py) | `_collect_dfx_artifacts` |
| pytest entry | [tests/st/conftest.py](../../../tests/st/conftest.py) | `pytest_addoption` |
| Harness pipeline ctx | [tests/st/harness/core/test_runner.py](../../../tests/st/harness/core/test_runner.py) | `start_pipeline(..., enable_*)` |

## Deprecated aliases

`RunConfig.runtime_profiling` and the pytest flag `--runtime-profiling`
were the original way to opt into L2 swimlane capture before the four
DFX features became independently controllable. They are kept as
aliases for `enable_l2_swimlane` / `--enable-l2-swimlane` so existing
scripts keep working; both paths emit a `DeprecationWarning` and will
be removed in a future release. Migrate to the new names.

## Replaying an existing build_output

To re-run a previously compiled `build_output/<jit_dir>/` after editing
one or more kernel cpp files — typically to verify a hand-tuned change
under PMU / swimlane / tensor-dump — use the debug-only
[`pypto.runtime.debug.replay`](../../../python/pypto/runtime/debug/replay.py)
module. It reuses the same `execute_compiled` path as the normal
`pypto.runtime.run` flow, so DFX flags behave identically.

```python
from pypto.runtime.debug import replay
from pypto.runtime import RunConfig

replay(
    "build_output/_jit_xxx/",
    a, b, c,
    config=RunConfig(
        platform="a2a3sim",
        enable_pmu=2,
        enable_l2_swimlane=True,
    ),
)
```

CLI form (loads inputs from the directory's `golden.py`):

```bash
python -m pypto.runtime.debug.replay build_output/_jit_xxx/ \
    --pmu 2 --swimlane --log-level debug
```

`recompile=True` (default) deletes cached `.so`/`.bin` artefacts so
hand-edited cpps are picked up. Pass `recompile=False` (or
`--no-recompile`) when no cpp changed and you want to skip the rebuild.
`--log-level` accepts the same values as `PYPTO_RUNTIME_LOG`
(`debug`, `v0..v9`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `null`); add
`--log-sync-pypto` to also push the band to PyPTO's C++ logger.

Pass `validate=True` (or `--validate`) to compare each output tensor
against the reference produced by `golden.py::compute_golden` using the
`RTOL`/`ATOL` tolerances declared in `golden.py`. Raises
`AssertionError` on mismatch. Requires the directory to contain a
`golden.py` (the default for `ir.compile`-produced artefacts).

### Editing `.pto` instead of cpp

`replay` (and the auto-emitted `debug/run.py`) checks `ptoas/*.pto`
mtimes before invalidating cpp binaries: any `.pto` newer than its
sibling `ptoas/<unit>.cpp` triggers a fresh `ptoas` run, and the new
preprocessed body is spliced between the `// --- ptoas-generated code
---` and `// --- Kernel entry point ---` sentinels in every matching
`kernels/<core>/<func>.cpp`. The cpp → `.so` rebuild then runs as
normal.

| You edited | What runs |
| ---------- | --------- |
| only `kernels/<core>/<func>.cpp` | `cpp → .so` (existing behaviour) |
| only `ptoas/<unit>.pto` | `pto → cpp → .so` (new — splice + recompile) |
| both | `pto` wins for the body region; your wrapper / header edits in the cpp are preserved |

Requires the `ptoas` binary on `PTOAS_ROOT` or `PATH`; silently no-ops
otherwise. Disable with `--no-rebuild-from-pto` or
`PYPTO_REBUILD_FROM_PTO=0`. Editing a `.pto` that changes the kernel
function signature is **out of scope** — the saved wrapper boilerplate
will not match, and a fresh `ir.compile()` is required.

### Auto-emitted `debug/run.py`

`ir.compile()` writes a self-contained re-runner at
`<output_dir>/debug/run.py` so the user only ever needs to remember one
command:

```bash
python build_output/<jit_dir>/debug/run.py
```

The script wraps the `replay` flow above:

- When a sibling `golden.py` is present, inputs come from
  `golden.generate_inputs()` and the run is validated against
  `compute_golden`.
- Otherwise (JIT path), inputs are materialised from the shape / dtype
  metadata embedded in the script. Edit them freely to experiment. The
  script also exposes a `_user_compare(<param_names>)` hook that runs
  after `replay` returns — write your own `assert torch.allclose(...)`
  there to validate kernel output against a hand-rolled reference.
- The same `.pto` rebuild flow described above applies: edit a `.pto`
  under `ptoas/`, rerun the script, and the splice happens
  transparently. Pass `--no-rebuild-from-pto` to skip.

Emission is **best-effort** — programs without a clean orchestration
entry skip the file silently and the rest of compilation succeeds.

Disable globally by setting `PYPTO_EMIT_DEBUG_RUNNER=0` (also accepts
`false` / `no`, case-insensitive). Useful for large test suites or
benchmark pipelines that compile many programs and don't need the
runner. When disabled, the underlying `pypto.runtime.debug.replay`
module / CLI is still usable directly against the output directory.
