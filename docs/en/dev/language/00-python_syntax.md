# Python IR Syntax Specification

## Overview

Python-style syntax for PyPTO IR:

- **Complete**: All information needed to reconstruct IR
- **Parseable**: Can be parsed back into IR (see [IR Parser](../ir/07-parser.md))
- **Pythonic**: Follows Python style, passes most linters
- **SSA-style**: Uses SSA with `pl.yield_()` and `pl.range()`

## Module Structure

```python
# pypto.program: program_name
import pypto.language as pl
```

For unnamed programs: `# pypto.program`

**Note:** Module prefix is configurable (default `pl`, legacy `ir`, custom allowed).

## Type System

### Scalar Types

```python
x: pl.INT64
y: pl.FP32
z: pl.BOOL
```

Available types:

| Category | Types |
| -------- | ----- |
| **Integers** | `INT4`, `INT8`, `INT16`, `INT32`, `INT64` |
| **Unsigned** | `UINT4`, `UINT8`, `UINT16`, `UINT32`, `UINT64` |
| **Float** | `FP4`, `FP8`, `FP16`, `FP32` |
| **Brain Float** | `BF16` |
| **Hisilicon** | `HF4`, `HF8` |
| **Boolean** | `BOOL` |

### Tensor and Tile Types

```python
# Tensor (subscript notation)
a: pl.Tensor[[4, 8], pl.FP32]      # Fixed shape
b: pl.Tensor[[n, m], pl.INT64]     # Symbolic shape

# Tile (block in unified buffer)
t: pl.Tile[[16, 16], pl.FP16]
```

### Tensor Layout and View

The third subscript element is a layout or a `pl.TensorView`, each written inline or
held in a variable — bind it once to share one view across several parameters. A
layout is shorthand for a stride-less view, so every form yields a `TensorView`.
Same slot and spellings for `pl.DistributedTensor`.

```python
STRIDED = pl.TensorView(stride=[128, 1], layout=pl.TensorLayout.ND)

x: pl.Tensor[[32, 64], pl.FP32, pl.NZ]      # layout, inline
y: pl.Tensor[[32, 64], pl.FP32, STRIDED]    # view, by variable
```

Under `@pl.jit` only the **layout** spelling is supported. Specialization
regenerates each annotation from the shape/dtype/layout it recorded, and a
`pl.TensorView` has no slot in that record — passing one raises a `TypeError`
naming the parameter rather than dropping the stride. Declare such a kernel
with `@pl.function`, which resolves the annotation directly.

### Memory References (MemRef)

```python
# Create MemRef
addr_expr = pl.ConstInt(0x1000, pl.INT64, span)
memref = pl.MemRef(addr_expr, 1024, 0)

# Memory spaces: DDR, Vec, Mat, Left, Right, Acc
# Note: pl.Mem is a short alias for pl.MemorySpace

# Tensor with memref
tensor: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32, pl.MemRef(addr_expr, 8192, 0)]

# Tiles keep memory space on the tile annotation, not inside MemRef
tile: pl.Tile[[16, 16], pl.FP16, pl.MemRef(addr_expr, 512, 0), pl.Mem.Left]
```

### Declared Allocations (one-argument MemRef)

A one-argument `pl.MemRef("name")` declares an allocation of your own, taking it out of
the compiler's opportunistic reuse. Tiles referencing it share it; nothing else is ever
packed in. Use it when the packer coalesces tiles you want to stay independent —
sharing storage adds a WAR dependency that serializes them.

It is the same IR node as the three-argument form; the arity says whether you are
describing an existing allocation or declaring one. Declaring gives only a name: the
size comes from the largest tile bound to it and the address from the allocator.

Declare it once, then reference it by variable. An unnamed declaration takes the name
of the variable it is bound to, so the name is written once:

```python
ping = pl.MemRef()
pong = pl.MemRef()

# Two tiles explicitly share one allocation; a third is kept private.
t0: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32, ping, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.load(a, [0, 0], [64, 64])
t1: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32, pong, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.exp(t0)
t2: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32, ping, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.exp(t1)
```

Prefer that form: a misspelled reference is a Python `NameError`, whereas a misspelled
string in the inline `pl.MemRef("pign")` form silently declares a second allocation. The
inline form stays valid — it is what the IR printer emits, so a dumped program reparses
without a surrounding Python scope, and `pl.MemRef("other")` also names a declaration
explicitly when the variable name is not the one you want in the IR.

Since the variable supplies the name, variable and allocation must correspond one to one.
Reaching one declaration through two names (`alias = ping`) and two declarations claiming
one name are both **rejected** — either would silently merge or split an allocation.

Whether a MemRef is a declaration is recorded explicitly on the IR node
(`MemRef.is_pinned_`), not inferred from its size or from which pass is running.
`InitMemRef` consumes the declaration: from there on the allocation carries
`pinned=True` and the MemRef is an ordinary one, so re-parsing a post-allocation dump
cannot turn compiler allocations into declared ones.

#### Slots

Pass `slots=N` for N equally-sized slots of one allocation, then pick one by subscript.
The slots are contiguous and uniformly sized, so rotating through them is a ping-pong the
packer cannot collapse:

```python
l0c = pl.MemRef(slots=2)

ping: pl.Tile[[M, N], pl.FP32, l0c[0], pl.Mem.Acc] = pl.tile.matmul(q, b0)
pong: pl.Tile[[M, N], pl.FP32, l0c[1], pl.Mem.Acc] = pl.tile.matmul(q, b1)
```

**The index may be a runtime value**, so a rotation needs no unrolling:

```python
for i, (acc,) in pl.range(N, init_values=(out,)):
    a: pl.Tile[[M, N], pl.FP32, l0c[i % 2], pl.Mem.Acc] = pl.tile.matmul(q_l0, b_l0)
```

Under `@pl.jit`, name the declaration inline — `pl.MemRef("l0c", slots=2)[i % 2]` — rather
than binding it to a Python variable. `@pl.jit` re-parses a generated source in a fresh
module namespace, so a declaration held in a variable is not in scope there. The named form
is self-contained (and is what the IR printer emits), so it works in both.

`InitMemRef` sizes one slot to the largest tile bound to *any* slot — the slots are
uniform, so a per-slot size would make the stride inconsistent — and turns the index into
the byte offset `index * slot_size`. A constant index folds there and takes the ordinary
constant-address path; a runtime one survives as an expression that becomes the tile's
address at run time.

Co-liveness is checked **per slot**, not per allocation: two tiles on different slots are
meant to be live together, and only two tiles landing on the *same* slot can corrupt each
other. When the index is a runtime expression there is no static slot to attribute a tile
to, so the check is skipped — the rotation is yours to get right — while isolation from
every other allocation still holds.

##### Under the ptoas memory planner

`slots=N` is the one declaration form `memory_planner=PTOAS` accepts. ptoas has a matching
concept — a `pto.alloc_multi_tile` region of N slots it must keep in disjoint physical
segments — so codegen hands it the declaration whole: one region, and each use selects its
slot with `pto.multi_tile_get`. The slot **index** is what ptoas receives (not the byte
offset it resolves to), which is what lets it prove which accesses can share a slot and
give the rotation per-slot event ids, overlapping iteration *i*'s load with iteration
*i-1*'s compute.

A single-slot `pl.MemRef()` has no such counterpart and stays rejected under that planner:
ptoas would be free to pack the buffer you separated. So does a multi-slot declaration
whose slots ptoas cannot describe — differently shaped tiles across slots, a space other
than Vec / Mat / Acc, a runtime valid shape, or a slot carried out of an `if` or loop as a
phi. Those are errors naming the shape, not silent fallbacks, because a fallback would
undo the separation you declared.

The default PyPTO planner is unaffected: it bakes addresses, and at
`--pto-level=level3` ptoas does not fold its per-slot address fan-out, so the region form
would there lose the very slot analysis it exists for
([PTOAS#1106](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/PTOAS/issues/1106)).

A declared name lives in its own namespace — it never resolves to a Python variable that
happens to share it. The memory space **is** required (a `TileType` always pairs a
MemRef with a space), and all tiles bound to one allocation must agree on it. Tiles left
unannotated keep the default automatic reuse.

Declarations do not clone per pipeline stage, so one inside a `pl.pipeline(stage=2)`
body is **rejected** whenever that loop is lowered by replication: the cloned stages would
make the tile co-live with itself on one allocation. Declaring slots and asking the
compiler to multi-buffer are alternatives, not layers. To manage a level yourself, drive it
with `pl.range` and declare one allocation per slot; leave the levels you want the compiler
to manage unannotated.

Under `memory_planner=PTOAS` the compiler reaches for the *same* mechanism rather than a
different one: [`LowerPipelineToSlots`](../passes/28-lower_pipeline_to_slots.md) synthesizes
exactly the declaration above — `slots=F`, indexed `iv % F` — for every eligible top-level
`tile.load` of a `pl.pipeline` body, so one body rotates through the slots instead of being
replicated. A tile you bound yourself is left alone, and any loop that pass declines still
goes down the replication path (where the rejection above applies).

```python
l0b_ping, l0b_pong = pl.MemRef(), pl.MemRef()

# Outer level compiler-managed, inner level author-managed ping-pong.
for stack, (out_outer,) in pl.pipeline(STACKS, stage=2, init_values=(out,)):
    b_l1: pl.Tile[[K, N], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.load(b, [stack * K, 0], [K, N])
    for col, (out_inner,) in pl.range(0, N, 2 * STEP, init_values=[out_outer]):
        ping: pl.Tile[[K, STEP], pl.BF16, l0b_ping, pl.Mem.Right] = ...
        pong: pl.Tile[[K, STEP], pl.BF16, l0b_pong, pl.Mem.Right] = ...
```

See [InitMemRef](../passes/32-init_memref.md#declared-allocations) and
[MemoryReuse](../passes/34-memory_reuse.md#declared-allocations).

### Tile Views (TileView)

```python
# Create TileView
valid_shape = [pl.ConstInt(16, pl.INT64, span)] * 2
stride = [pl.ConstInt(1, pl.INT64, span), pl.ConstInt(16, pl.INT64, span)]
start_offset = pl.ConstInt(0, pl.INT64, span)
tile_view = pl.TileView(valid_shape=valid_shape, stride=stride, start_offset=start_offset)

# Tile with memref and tile_view
tile: pl.Tile[
    [16, 16], pl.FP16,
    pl.MemRef(addr_expr, 512, 0), pl.Mem.Left,
    pl.TileView(valid_shape=..., stride=..., start_offset=...)
]
```

**Notes:**

- Omitting `pl.TileView(...)` does **not** mean "no TileView semantics". The DSL infers an implicit
  TileView from the tile shape and, when present, the tile memory space.
- In that implicit form, `valid_shape` defaults to the tile shape. Layout/fractal defaults are also
  inferred from the shape / memory-space combination.
- An explicit `pl.TileView()` (or one that only repeats those implicit defaults) is treated as
  semantically equivalent to the omitted form. Parser / printer roundtrips may canonicalize both
  forms to the same printed syntax.
- `compact=pl.CompactMode.normal` represents PTO's packed transfer format for a partial boxed tile.
  PyPTO infers it for partial `tile.extract` results in L0A/L0B, so kernels normally should not set it
  directly.

## Expressions

### Variables and Constants

```python
x                       # Variable reference
tensor_a                # Tensor variable
42                      # Integer literal — INDEX-typed
3.14                    # Float literal
pl.const(42, pl.INT64)  # Typed integer literal (any non-INDEX dtype)
```

A bare integer literal is always `INDEX`-typed. To carry any other integer
dtype (e.g. `INT64`), use `pl.const(value, dtype)` — this is also how the
printer renders such constants so printed IR round-trips through the parser.
Inside composite shape dimensions and pure-constant arithmetic (e.g.
`pl.const(32, pl.INDEX) + pl.const(32, pl.INDEX)`), the printer emits typed
leaves even for `INDEX` so the parser rebuilds the tree verbatim instead of
constant-folding it; simplification stays the Simplify pass's job.

**Closure variables:** Names not found in the DSL scope are resolved from the enclosing Python scope. Supported types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, and IR expressions.

```python
OFFSET = [0, 0]
TILE_SHAPE = [64, 64]

@pl.function
def func(t: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32], out: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]:
    a: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.tile.load(t, OFFSET, TILE_SHAPE)  # closure vars as positional args
    ...
```

### Subscript Indexing

`Tensor` and `Tile` subscripts use numpy/torch-style semantics:

- A **scalar** index removes its dimension; a **slice** keeps it.
- Fewer indices than `rank` implies trailing `:` — `C[i]` on a 4D tensor is `C[i, :, :, :]`.
- Chained indexing composes — `C[i][j]` is two rank-reducing views.
- An **all-scalar, full-rank** index reads a scalar (`A[i, j]` on a 2D tensor → `tensor.read` / `tile.read`).

```python
C[i, j, k, l]   # all scalar, full rank   -> scalar
C[i, j]         # partial, all scalar      -> 64×64 view (dims 0,1 dropped)
C[i]            # partial                  -> 64×64×64 view (dim 0 dropped)
C[i][j]         # chained                  -> works (C[i] is 3D, then [j])
C[i:i+8, j]     # mixed slice + scalar     -> 8×64×64 view (dim 1 dropped)
C[i:i+8, :, :, :]  # all slices            -> 8×64×64×64 view
```

Restrictions (v1): no slice `step`, tile slice lower bounds must be static-foldable, no ellipsis / `None` / negative / advanced indexing. **Tiles are physically 2D**, so a tile result that would naturally be `< 2D` is auto-promoted to 2D (`[N]` → `[1, N]`) with a non-fatal warning — pass an explicit `pl.tile.reshape` if you want a different layout.

Mechanism: a non-trivial subscript lowers to `tensor.slice` / `tile.slice` with full-rank `shape`/`offset` plus a `drop_dims` list of the scalar-indexed axes (see the IR operator docs). The same rules apply on the assignment LHS — `C[i, j] = rhs` reshapes `rhs` back to the full-rank window before `tensor.assemble` (chained writes `C[i][j] = rhs` are not yet supported).

### Binary Operations

| Python Operator | PyPTO IR | Category |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- |
| `+` | Add | Arithmetic |
| `-` | Sub | Arithmetic |
| `*` | Mul | Arithmetic |
| `//` | FloorDiv | Arithmetic |
| `%` | FloorMod | Arithmetic |
| `/` | FloatDiv | Arithmetic |
| `**` | Pow | Arithmetic |
| `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | Eq, Ne, Lt, Le, Gt, Ge | Comparison |
| `and`, `or` | And, Or | Logical |
| `^` | Xor | Logical |
| `&` | BitAnd | Bitwise |
| `\|` | BitOr | Bitwise |
| `<<`, `>>` | BitShiftLeft, BitShiftRight | Bitwise |

**Note:** `and`/`or` are parsed from Python's `ast.BoolOp` syntax. Chained expressions like `a and b and c` are folded left-to-right into `And(And(a, b), c)`. Unlike Python, IR `And`/`Or` nodes evaluate both operands (no short-circuit semantics). The corresponding IR factory functions are `ir.and_(lhs, rhs)` and `ir.or_(lhs, rhs)`.

### Unary Operations and Functions

```python
-x              # Neg
~x              # BitNot
not x           # Not
abs(x)          # Abs
min(a, b)       # Min
max(a, b)       # Max
```

### Function/Op Calls

```python
# Explicit namespace
pl.tensor.add(a, b)                  # Tensor addition
pl.tile.load(t, [0, 0], [64, 64])      # Tile load

# Unified dispatch (auto-selects tensor/tile based on input type)
pl.add(a, b)                          # Tensor or Tile — dispatched automatically
pl.mul(tile, 2.0)                     # Tile + scalar → tile.muls
pl.exp(tile)                          # Tile → tile.exp

# Promoted ops (single-module ops accessible at pl.*)
pl.load(t, [0, 0], [64, 64])            # Promoted from block
pl.create_tensor([64], dtype=pl.FP32)       # Promoted from tensor

# System operations (synchronization primitives)
pl.system.sync_src(set_pipe=pl.PipeType.MTE2, wait_pipe=pl.PipeType.V, event_id=0)
pl.system.sync_dst(set_pipe=pl.PipeType.MTE2, wait_pipe=pl.PipeType.V, event_id=0)
pl.system.bar_v()                        # Vector barrier
pl.system.bar_m()                        # Matrix barrier
pl.system.bar_all()                      # Global barrier

# Cross-core operations (TPUSH/TPOP protocol)
pl.tpush_to_aic(tile0, split=0, id=0)        # Vector → Cube push on pipe 0
pl.tpush_to_aic(tile1, split=0, id=1)        # Vector → Cube push on pipe 1
tile0 = pl.tpop_from_aiv(split=0, id=0)      # Cube pops from Vector pipe 0
tile1 = pl.tpop_from_aiv(split=0, id=1)      # Cube pops from Vector pipe 1
pl.tfree_to_aiv(tile0, id=0)                 # Release slot to Vector pipe 0
pl.tfree_to_aiv(tile1, id=1)                 # Release slot to Vector pipe 1

# Cross-core pipe initialization and buffer management
buf = pl.reserve_buffer(name="slot_buf", size=4096, base=pl.AUTO)
peer = pl.import_peer_buffer(name="slot_buf", peer_func="other_func")
pl.aic_initialize_pipe(pl.const(0, pl.INT32), buf, dir_mask=2, slot_size=512, id=0)
pl.aiv_initialize_pipe(pl.const(0, pl.INT32), peer, dir_mask=2, slot_size=512, id=0)
# Optional: pin the GM ring-buffer slot count (default 8 unidirectional / 4
# bidirectional) and, on a2/a3, the local slot count (must be <= slot_num).
# Size the reserved buffer yourself: a3 -> slot_size * local_slot_num,
# a5 -> slot_size * slot_num.
pl.aic_initialize_pipe(pl.const(0, pl.INT32), buf, dir_mask=2, slot_size=512, slot_num=16, local_slot_num=4)
```

## Statements

### Assignment

```python
x: pl.INT64 = expr
y: pl.Tensor[[4], pl.FP32] = tensor_op(a)
```

### If Statement (SSA-style)

```python
# If with both branches
if condition:
    y1 = pl.yield_(value1)
else:
    y1 = pl.yield_(value2)

# Multiple return values (no inline type annotations)
if condition:
    y1, y2 = pl.yield_(value1, value2)
else:
    y1, y2 = pl.yield_(value3, value4)
```

**Key points:**

- `pl.yield_()` assigns to SSA phi nodes
- Variables defined in yield become accessible after if
- Both branches must yield the same variables
- Type annotations cannot be used inline with tuple unpacking

### For Loop (SSA-style with iter_args)

```python
# Simple loop (1-3 positional args, like Python's range())
for i in pl.range(stop):                    # start=0, step=1
for i in pl.range(start, stop):             # step=1
for i in pl.range(start, stop, step):       # explicit

# Loop with iter_args (loop-carried values)
sum_init: pl.INT64 = 0
for i, (sum,) in pl.range(n, init_values=(sum_init,)):
    sum = pl.yield_(sum + i)
sum_final = sum

# Parallel for loop (same 1-3 arg forms)
for i in pl.parallel(stop):
for i in pl.parallel(start, stop, step):
    body_statements
```

**Key points:** Loop-carried values use `pl.range()` or `pl.parallel()` with `init_values`, tuple unpacking `(sum,)` declares iter_args, `pl.yield_()` updates values for next iteration, after loop iter_args contain final values. `pl.parallel()` produces a `ForKind.Parallel` loop while `pl.range()` produces `ForKind.Sequential` (default).

### While Loop (SSA-style with iter_args)

```python
# Natural while: condition is the while-header expression
i: pl.Scalar[pl.INT64] = 0
while i < n:
    i = i + 1

# SSA form with init_values: header tuple = iter_args, first stmt is pl.cond().
# yield-LHS supplies the post-loop binding name (mirrors pl.range).
x_init: pl.Scalar[pl.INT64] = 0
for (x,) in pl.while_(init_values=(x_init,)):
    pl.cond(x < n)
    x_next = pl.yield_(x + 1)
# `x_next` is bound here (from the yield-LHS); `x` is loop-scoped only.

# Pre-SSA: no pl.yield_ at all; ConvertToSSA synthesizes it later.
for (x,) in pl.while_(init_values=(x_init,)):
    pl.cond(x < n)
    x = x + 1

# ❌ Bare pl.yield_(...) with non-empty init_values is rejected at parse time:
#    for (x,) in pl.while_(init_values=(x_init,)):
#        pl.cond(x < n)
#        pl.yield_(x + 1)             # ParserSyntaxError: requires assignment-form pl.yield_
```

**Key points:** `pl.while_(init_values=(...,))` reuses the `for ... in` header for SSA-style loops; the first body statement must be `pl.cond(<bool>)`. The post-loop binding name comes from the **yield-LHS** (`x_next` above), not the header tuple — header-tuple names are scoped to the loop body only. This convention is **uniform with `pl.range`**: assignment-form yield is required whenever `init_values` is non-empty AND the body contains a `pl.yield_(...)` call. Pre-SSA loops with no yield at all are still valid (last form above).

### Scope Context Managers

| Form | Scope Kind | Notes |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| `pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP)` | `InCore` | Fixed-boundary outline at CORE_GROUP |
| `pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.split(MODE)])` | `InCore` | InCore + cross-core split hint |
| `pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)])` | `InCore` | InCore + cross-core pipe slot count |
| `pl.at(level=pl.Level.HOST)` *(or any non-`CORE_GROUP` level)* | `Hierarchy` | Distributed hierarchy scope |
| `pl.cluster()` | `Cluster` | Co-scheduled AIC+AIV group |
| `with pl.spmd(N)` / `for i in pl.spmd(N)` | `Spmd` (for-form wraps inner `InCore`) | SPMD multi-block dispatch — see [pl.spmd](#plspmd-multi-block-dispatch) |
| `pl.spmd(N, optimizations=[pl.split(MODE)])` | `Spmd(InCore(split=MODE))` | Split hint applies to the inner InCore (both forms) |
| `pl.spmd(N, optimizations=[pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)])` | `Spmd(InCore(slot_num=N))` | Slot count applies to the inner InCore (both forms); combinable with `pl.split(MODE)` |
| `pl.scope(mode=pl.ScopeMode.MANUAL)` / `pl.manual_scope()` | `Runtime(manual=true)` | Orchestrator MANUAL scope — user manages task ordering. Allowed in either `auto_scope` mode (it is a dependency-semantics choice). See [Manual dependency primitives](#manual-dependency-primitives) |
| `pl.scope()` | `Runtime(manual=false)` | Orchestrator AUTO scope (`PTO2_SCOPE()`). Hand-placing one requires `@pl.function(auto_scope=False)` (in the default `auto_scope=True` the compiler owns AUTO placement). See [MaterializeRuntimeScopes](../passes/45-materialize_runtime_scopes.md) |

See [Scopes and Placement](../../user/language/04-scopes.md) for examples.

#### `pl.spmd` multi-block dispatch

`pl.spmd(N)` dispatches a kernel across `N` blocks. Forms:

- `with pl.spmd(N): ...` — body is **either** a *dispatch* body calling a pre-defined InCore kernel (`SpmdScopeStmt(body=<stmts>)`, no inner InCore wrapper) **or** an *inline* block auto-outlined into a synthetic InCore region (like the for-form, minus the auto-bound index). Decided semantically, not by statement count: a body reading `pl.tile.get_block_idx()` is inline and gets wrapped; otherwise it is a dispatch body and stays unwrapped, however many statements it holds. A body that neither reads the index nor dispatches a `self.<kernel>(...)` call is rejected. Captures no producer TaskId.
  - An explicit `with pl.at(<CORE_GROUP level>, ...):` as the sole body statement *is* the InCore carrier: parsed as an ordinary nested scope, not wrapped a second time (positional or keyword `level`, with or without `as tid` / `name_hint=`). This is the form the printer emits for `Spmd(InCore(...))`, so it is what makes that IR round-trip. When the body provides a carrier, `optimizations=` must go on that `pl.at(...)` — putting it on the `pl.spmd(...)` line is rejected, whether or not the carrier also carries one.
  - A dispatch body may launch **one** kernel. It is lowered via `FindFirstInnerCall`, which stops at the first call, so a second dispatch would be silently dropped rather than launched; the parser rejects it instead. Hoisted temporaries and tuple projections are not dispatches and do not count.
- `for i in pl.spmd(N): ...` — loop variable binds the per-block index (`pl.tile.get_block_idx()`); the body is auto-outlined into a synthetic InCore region.
- `with pl.spmd(N, deps=[...]) as tid: ...` — **capture form**: mirrors `with pl.at(...) as tid:`. Same body shapes as the plain form above, and additionally captures the dispatch's grid-wide producer `pl.Scalar[pl.TASK_ID]` in `tid` (usable as a `deps=` edge, stored into a `pl.array.create(N, pl.TASK_ID)`, or crossed into `pl.manual_scope`). TaskId capture is orthogonal to the inline body — it is the only thing this form adds over the plain form. Lowers to an `ir.Submit` whose trailing tuple element is the grid TaskId; `core_num` / `sync_start` ride on that `Submit`'s own fields (the launch spec belongs to the launch site, not the outlined callee). See [Manual dependency primitives](#manual-dependency-primitives).
- `out, tid = pl.spmd_submit(kernel, *args, core_num=N)` — **submit form**: dispatches the kernel across `N` blocks *and* captures the dispatch's producer `pl.Scalar[pl.TASK_ID]` (the `pl.submit` sibling for a pre-defined kernel). See [Manual dependency primitives](#manual-dependency-primitives).

All three `pl.spmd(...)` scope forms also accept `allow_early_resolve=True` (a boolean literal; same early-dispatch opt-in as `pl.submit` / `pl.at`). It forces the dispatch to lower to an `ir.Submit` even without `as tid` and lowers to `Arg::set_allow_early_resolve(true)`. Rejected on a `pl.cluster()`-nested `pl.spmd` (such a scope is unwrapped into the Group function and never produces a Submit, so the hint would be lost).

Optional `optimizations=[...]`. The entries are orthogonal and may be combined
in one list (e.g. `[pl.split(MODE), pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=4)]`):

| Entry | Form | Effect |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| `pl.split(MODE)` | both | Sets the inner InCore's `split_` field (cross-core transfer hint, consumed by `ExpandMixedKernel` / `MemoryReuse`). The with-form gains an inner `InCoreScopeStmt` wrapper around the call. |
| `pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)` | both | Sets the inner InCore's `slot_num` attr — the slot count (ring depth) of the automatic cross-core pipe, consumed by `ExpandMixedKernel`. Sizes a data channel only; it does **not** partition work, so it coexists with `pl.split_aiv` regions where `pl.split(...)` does not. Omit to keep the PTOAS default (8 one-directional, 4 per direction bidirectional). |

### Manual dependency primitives

By default the runtime auto-derives task→task dependencies from buffer
read/write overlap (the `OverlapMap`). The DSL exposes **two orthogonal
mechanisms** the user can combine:

> **The two mechanisms are independent.** Opting a buffer / region / arg
> out of auto-tracking does **not** require declaring explicit edges, and
> declaring explicit edges does **not** require turning auto-tracking off.
> The final task fanin is **`auto-tracked deps ∪ explicit deps`** — they
> compose, they don't substitute for each other.

#### Mechanism A — opt out of auto-dep tracking (3 granularities)

All three granularities are independent of each other. Pick the smallest
unit that fits your use case; combine if needed.

| Surface | Granularity | Effect |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `with pl.manual_scope():` | per-region | Lowers to `PTO2_SCOPE(PTO2ScopeMode::MANUAL)`. Inside, the runtime never auto-tracks; the user must declare every required ordering edge explicitly (see Mechanism B). |
| `pl.create_tensor([...], dtype=..., manual_dep=True)` | per-tensor lifetime | Every task that reads or writes this tensor skips `OverlapMap` lookup and insert for its **entire lifetime**, regardless of scope. Useful for scratch buffers that are managed entirely by explicit edges. |
| `pl.no_dep(arg)` | per-call argument | At a kernel call site, the wrapped argument's `ArgDirection` becomes `NoDep` — auto-tracking ignores that slot **for this submission only**. Legal regardless of whether the callee declares the slot as `In`, `Out`, or `InOut`: the user asserts out-of-band that there is no RaW / WaW / WaR conflict on this slot (e.g. paged-attention writes whose offset is data-dependent but disjoint by allocation protocol). No effect inside `pl.manual_scope` (the scope already disables auto-tracking). |
| `with pl.at(..., no_dep_args=[t1, t2]):` | per-arg, on a `pl.at`-block | The `pl.at`-block analogue of `pl.no_dep(arg)`. The outliner makes the listed tensors arguments of the synthesised kernel call; `DeriveCallDirections` then forces those arg slots to `NoDep` — same effect as wrapping the tensors with `pl.no_dep(...)` at an explicit call site. Each entry must be a bare tensor name visible to the enclosing scope. Same In / Out / InOut applicability as `pl.no_dep(arg)`: a captured tensor that the scope body mutates via `pl.assemble` becomes `InOut` on the synthesised kernel, and `no_dep_args=` overrides it to `NoDep` just as it overrides `In`. Note: `no_dep_args=` takes **tensors**, while `deps=` takes **TaskIds** — same word "dep", different layer. |

#### Mechanism B — declare explicit task→task edges (`deps=`)

These surfaces all produce `set_dependencies` codegen; choose by producer
shape (single kernel call, outlined `pl.at` region, or dependency-only fan-in).

| Surface | Producer shape | Notes |
| ------- | -------------- | ----- |
| `result, tid = pl.submit(kernel, *args, deps=[...], allow_early_resolve=False)` | single kernel call | The trailing `tid` is the producer `pl.Scalar[pl.TASK_ID]`. A parser construct (like `pl.range`), not a runtime function. `allow_early_resolve=True` opts this task in as a speculative early-dispatch producer (lets the scheduler pre-stage its consumers; lowers to `Arg::set_allow_early_resolve(true)`). Also accepts `predicate=(t[i] > 0)` — a dispatch predicate the scheduler evaluates at the dispatch point (see [Dispatch predicate](#dispatch-predicate-predicate)). |
| `result, tid = pl.spmd_submit(kernel, *args, core_num=N, sync_start=False, deps=[...])` | single SPMD task launch | The SPMD sibling of `pl.submit`: dispatches the kernel across `N` blocks (one orchestration task → one `tid`). `core_num` is a required keyword (positive int expr); `sync_start=True` forces atomic launch of all blocks. Callee may be InCore / AIC / AIV / Group. Records the launch spec on `Submit.core_num` / `Submit.sync_start`. Also accepts `allow_early_resolve=True` (same early-dispatch opt-in as `pl.submit`) and `predicate=(t[i] > 0)` (see [Dispatch predicate](#dispatch-predicate-predicate)). |
| `with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, deps=[...]) as tid:` | outlined `pl.at`-block | The whole block is outlined into an `InCore` kernel + `Submit`; `tid` captures the synthesized Submit's TaskId, usable as a dep for later `pl.submit` / `pl.at` sites. Without `as tid` the outliner synthesizes an unused TaskId Var — deps always travel on `Submit::deps_`. Also accepts `allow_early_resolve=True` (same early-dispatch opt-in as `pl.submit`); it forces the `Submit` shape even without `as tid` and lowers to `Arg::set_allow_early_resolve(true)`. |
| `with pl.spmd(N, deps=[...]) as tid:` | outlined SPMD dispatch | The SPMD sibling of the `pl.at ... as tid` form. The inline body is auto-outlined into an `InCore` kernel and dispatched across `N` blocks; `tid` captures the grid-wide producer TaskId. `deps=` accepted only with `as tid`. `core_num` / `sync_start` ride on the lowered `Submit`'s own `core_num` / `sync_start` fields (the launch spec belongs to the launch site, not the outlined callee); codegen reads them from there. Also accepts `allow_early_resolve=True` (same early-dispatch opt-in as `pl.submit` / `pl.at`; valid on all three `pl.spmd` forms, forcing the `Submit` shape even without `as tid`) and `predicate=(t[i] > 0)` (see [Dispatch predicate](#dispatch-predicate-predicate); also valid on all three forms and also forces the `Submit` shape). Cannot nest inside `pl.cluster()`. |
| `barrier = pl.system.task_dummy(deps=[...])` | dependency-only barrier | Submits no kernel. The returned TaskId is a compact fan-in point for later `deps=[barrier]`. |
| `None` (Python literal) | seed / dep entry | The "no producer yet" sentinel. `prev_tid = None` seeds a TaskId loop iter_arg; `None` in `deps=[None]` is dropped (contributes no edge). Lowers to `system.task_invalid` → `PTO2TaskId::invalid()`. |

**These surfaces work regardless of Mechanism A state.** Use explicit deps in
plain auto-tracked orchestration, inside `pl.manual_scope()`, or with a
`manual_dep=True` tensor; explicit edges are added on top of auto-tracking.
The earlier "`deps=` only inside `pl.manual_scope`" restriction no longer applies.

Plain `out = self.kernel(...)` is **fire-and-forget**: it returns no task
id, and `deps=` is rejected on it (the parser raises, hinting "use
`pl.submit`"). Each `deps=[...]` entry must be a TaskId value: a `tid`
bound by a prior `pl.submit(...)` / `pl.at(..., deps=) as tid`, the result of
`pl.system.task_dummy(deps=[...])`, a TaskId loop iter_arg carry, a
`Scalar[TASK_ID]` read from a TaskId array slot (`prev = tids[k]`), an
`Array[N, TASK_ID]` from `pl.array.create(N, pl.TASK_ID)`, or the literal
`None`. Tensors are **not** accepted in `deps=[...]`.

```python
# Example 1 — both mechanisms together: scope-wide opt-out + explicit edge.
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32],
         scratch: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]],
         out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    with pl.manual_scope():                                           # Mechanism A: scope-wide
        scratch, stage1_tid = pl.submit(self.stage1, x, scratch)
        out, _ = pl.submit(self.stage2, scratch, out, deps=[stage1_tid])  # Mechanism B
    return out
```

```python
# Example 2 — Mechanism B alone, NO manual_scope. Auto-tracking stays on
# for everything else; the explicit edge is *added on top* of whatever
# auto-tracking decided. Note the absence of `with pl.manual_scope():`.
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32],
         out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    tmp, prep_tid = pl.submit(self.preprocess, x)
    out, _ = pl.submit(self.consume, tmp, out, deps=[prep_tid])
    return out
```

```python
# Example 3 — pl.at-block as the producer, with deps= on a downstream block.
# `as tid` captures the synthesized outlined-Call's TaskId.
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32],
         out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP) as tid_a:
        # body becomes an outlined InCore kernel
        ...
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, deps=[tid_a]) as tid_b:
        # explicit edge — runs strictly after the `tid_a` block
        ...
    return out
```

```python
# Example 4 — Mechanism A tensor-lifetime: scratch buffer opted out for its
# whole lifetime; explicit edge still pins the ordering between producer
# and consumer.
scratch = pl.create_tensor([N], dtype=pl.FP32, manual_dep=True)
scratch, prod_tid = pl.submit(self.fill, x, scratch)
out, _ = pl.submit(self.consume, scratch, out, deps=[prod_tid])
```

`pl.submit` desugars to a single `ir.Submit` whose return type is the flat
augmented `TupleType([*<kernel return types>, ScalarType(TASK_ID)])` —
elements `0..N-1` are the kernel results, element `N` is the producer
TaskId. The parser writes each `deps=[...]` list directly into the typed
`Submit::deps_` field (no plain `Call` ever carries `manual_dep_edges` —
the ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly invariant). `pl.at(..., deps=)` follows the same
path: the outliner reads `attrs["task_id_var"]` and `attrs["manual_dep_edges"]`
on the `ScopeStmt` and lifts them onto a synthesized `Submit` (a scope with
deps but no `as tid` gets a synthetic unused TaskId Var so the dispatch is
still a Submit). Codegen fills a fixed-size stack array sized to the
exact dep count and emits one `params.set_dependencies(arr, count);`
call per task. The runtime's `Arg::set_dependencies(ptr, count)` accepts a
caller-owned array of arbitrary size, so there is no per-call edge cap.
For explicit fan-in, write `barrier = pl.system.task_dummy(deps=[tids])` and
then `pl.submit(..., deps=[barrier])`; it uses the same dependency parser,
lowers to `rt_submit_dummy_task(...)`, returns invalid without submitting when
all deps are invalid, and coexists with automatic `ExpandManualPhaseFence`
barriers for profitable full-array phase fences.

`pl.no_dep(arg)` is an auto-scope primitive; inside `pl.manual_scope` it
has no effect (the whole region already skips auto-tracking).

#### Dispatch predicate (`predicate=`)

`pl.submit` / `pl.spmd_submit` accept an optional
`predicate=(tensor[indices] <op> target)`. The scheduler evaluates the
comparison **at the dispatch point** — after the task's dependencies are
satisfied, so the value is current without an orchestration-time
`wait_for_tensor_ready` stall. When the comparison is **false** the task is
**retired inline** (never dispatched to a core) while still settling
fanin/fanout, so downstream consumers still unlock — it does not vanish from the
task graph. When **true** it dispatches normally.

The canonical use is MoE "skip empty experts": submit every expert statically,
each carrying `predicate=(row_count[e] > 0)` and depending on the gather
producer — the scheduler dispatches only the non-empty experts, without stalling
orchestration to read the per-expert count.

> **The comparison is parsed as an ordinary expression, but never evaluated.**
> `rc[0, 0]` is the usual sugar for `pl.read`, so the kwarg lowers to plain IR —
> `Gt(Cast(tensor.read(rc, [0, 0])), 0)` — reusing the IR's existing comparison
> nodes rather than any bespoke encoding. It is stored on `Submit.predicate`,
> never in a statement position, so the `tensor.read` is **not** executed in
> orchestration: doing so would stall on `wait_for_tensor_ready`, exactly what
> the predicate exists to avoid. Orchestration codegen decomposes the Expr into
> the runtime's `operand OP target` triple, so only the shape below is accepted.

| Part | Meaning | Constraint |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| `tensor` | operand tensor read at the dispatch point | must be a named tensor (a parameter or a variable bound to one), subscripted to one element |
| `indices` | element locator into `tensor` | each index an integer scalar (`ConstInt` or an int/index `Var`); one index per `tensor` dimension |
| `<op>` | comparison | one of `==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` (a single, unchained comparison) |
| `target` | right-hand side | an **integer literal** (may be negative) |

The mirrored order is accepted — `0 < rc[e]` means the same as `rc[e] > 0`. The
IR keeps the comparison as written; orchestration codegen flips the operator so
the tensor is always the runtime's operand.

Lowers to the runtime `L0TaskPredicate` + `Arg::set_predicate(...)` in
orchestration codegen (operand → its `ext_<name>` reference, `op` →
`PredicateOp::*`, `target` verbatim; `elem_size` is derived by the runtime from
the tensor dtype).

**Contract:** the predicate operand tensor's producer **must** be one of the
submit's `deps=`, so the dispatch-point read observes the current value. Omitting
it lets the scheduler evaluate the predicate before the producer has written the
tensor, deciding from stale data.

The parser makes a **best-effort spot check**, not a guarantee: it tracks the
result variables a `pl.submit(...)` binds via tuple unpacking, and rejects a
predicate whose operand is one of them when the producing TaskId is absent from
`deps=`. Treat a clean parse as "no obvious mistake found", not as proof.

It does **not** see through, and therefore silently accepts:

| Not covered | Why |
| ----------- | --- |
| `rc2 = rc` then `rc2[0, 0]` | the alias is a fresh variable with no recorded producer |
| a tensor passed as an `pl.Out` argument and rebound under a new name | only the returned binding is tracked, not the argument alias |
| `rc3 = self.helper(rc)` | any intervening call launders the association |
| `res = pl.spmd_submit(...)` (single-target form) | the single-target path records nothing |
| any `deps=` list containing an `Array[N, TASK_ID]` entry — including the common `deps=[tids[i]]` | array entries do not name their producers individually, so the whole check is skipped for that submit |
| a producer written **later** in the source, e.g. a loop-carried `rc` written by the previous iteration | the lookup happens while parsing the predicate, so producers that follow it are not yet recorded |

Getting `deps=` right therefore remains the author's responsibility.

**Expressiveness** is fixed to `tensor[indices] OP const` — one comparison,
matching the runtime's single-comparison `DispatchPredicate`. Chained
comparisons (`0 < t[i] < 8`), arithmetic (`t[i] % 8 == 0`), boolean combination
(`a[0] > 0 and b[0] > 0`), and a non-literal right-hand side (`t[i] > u[i]`) are
all rejected at parse time; reduce anything richer to a single gate value in a
prior kernel and predicate on that.

```python
with pl.manual_scope():
    rc, g_tid = pl.spmd_submit(self.gate, rc, core_num=1)       # producer of rc
    out, _ = pl.spmd_submit(
        self.expert, x, out, core_num=1,
        deps=[g_tid],                                           # producer is a dep
        predicate=(rc[0, 0] > 0),
    )
```

**Scope:** `predicate=` is accepted on `pl.submit` / `pl.spmd_submit` (the
direct-`Submit` forms) and on the `with pl.spmd(...)` scope form — all three
spmd spellings (plain `with`, `with ... as tid`, and `for i in pl.spmd(...)`).
It is not accepted on `pl.at(...)`.

##### Scope form

The scope form takes the same expression and the same validation; it differs
only in how the predicate reaches the IR. It rides on `SpmdScopeStmt.attrs`
until the scope is outlined, at which point it moves onto `Submit.predicate` —
so the lowering, the codegen output, and the contract are identical.

```python
with pl.spmd(1) as g_tid:                                       # producer of rc
    rc = self.gate(rc)

with pl.spmd(4, deps=[g_tid], predicate=(rc[0, 0] > 0)) as tid:  # producer is a dep
    out = self.expert(x, out)
```

Two things follow from that route:

- **`deps=` needs the `as tid` form.** `deps=` is only accepted on
  `with pl.spmd(...) as tid:`. A predicate over a tensor produced elsewhere in
  the same function therefore needs that form — the plain `with` and `for`
  forms can only carry a predicate over a tensor with no in-function producer
  (typically a function parameter), which the contract check permits.
- **No `as tid` is required otherwise.** Like `allow_early_resolve=True`, a
  predicate forces the scope to lower to a `Submit`; when the scope has no
  `as tid` the outliner synthesises an unused TaskId Var.

A cluster-nested `pl.spmd` is unwrapped into the Group function and never
produces a `Submit`, so `predicate=` (like `allow_early_resolve=`) is rejected
there at parse time rather than silently dropped.

The contract check covers scope producers too: a tensor assigned inside a
`with pl.spmd(...) as tid:` body is recorded as produced by that scope, so
omitting it from a later `deps=` is rejected. The same best-effort limits in the
table above still apply (aliases, intervening calls, `Array[N, TASK_ID]` deps).

#### `pl.parallel` under manual scope: array-carry fence

When a manual-dep edge is carried through a `pl.parallel` loop (i.e. the
loop's iter_arg holds the TaskId being depended on), the orchestration codegen
treats the corresponding TaskId iter_arg as **an array of size equal to the
parallel loop's trip count**. Each parallel iteration writes its own slot,
and downstream consumers depend on **every** slot (not just the
last-dispatched task). This guarantees the user-declared fence semantics
even when iters finish out of dispatch order.

Requirements for the array-carry path:

- The `pl.parallel` trip count must be a Python literal (statically known).
  A dynamic trip count under `pl.parallel` carrying a manual dep is rejected
  at codegen with a "statically-known trip count" message.

```python
with pl.manual_scope():
    prev_tid = None                                      # seed: no producer yet
    for phase in pl.range(N_PHASES):
        for branch in pl.parallel(N_BRANCHES):           # const trip count
            row = (phase * N_BRANCHES + branch) * TILE_M
            out, prev_tid = pl.submit(self.kernel_stripe, data, row, 1.0, out, deps=[prev_tid])
```

`prev_tid` is rebound inside `pl.parallel`, so codegen lowers the carry as
a `PTO2TaskId[N_BRANCHES]` array. Each task in phase `N+1` waits for all
`N_BRANCHES` tasks of phase `N`, not just the last-dispatched one.

### Yield Statement

```python
yield            # No values
yield x          # Single value
yield x, y       # Multiple values
```

### Break and Continue

```python
break              # Exit innermost loop
continue           # Skip to next iteration
```

**Restrictions:** Only valid when the **innermost** enclosing loop is sequential (`pl.range`) or `while`. Not supported when the innermost loop is `pl.parallel()` or `pl.unroll()`. A `break` in an inner `pl.range` loop nested inside an outer `pl.parallel` loop is valid. **Note:** Codegen backend support for `break`/`continue` is tracked in [#448](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto/issues/448).

### Compile-Time Debugging

`pl.static_print()` and `pl.static_assert()` are parse-time-only constructs for inspecting IR state and asserting conditions during parsing. They produce **no IR**.

```python
@pl.function
def func(x: pl.Tensor[[128, 64], pl.FP16]) -> pl.Tensor[[128, 64], pl.FP16]:
    pl.static_print("input:", x)          # → static_print [file:line]: input: x: pl.Tensor[[128, 64], pl.FP16]
    pl.static_print(f"input: {x}")        # → static_print [file:line]: input: x: pl.Tensor[[128, 64], pl.FP16]
    pl.static_assert(True)                # passes silently
    pl.static_assert(N > 32, "N too small")  # checks closure variable N at parse time
    return x
```

| Function | Purpose | On failure |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `pl.static_print(*args)` | Print variable types/values to stdout | Requires ≥1 argument |
| `pl.static_assert(cond, msg="")` | Assert compile-time condition | Raises `ParserError` |
| `pl.dump_tag(tensor)` | Mark a tensor for selective runtime tensor dump — declarative per-tensor marker (valid in Orchestration scope, or in an Inline helper that the orch inlines — see [Runtime DFX](../03-runtime-dfx.md#selective-tensor-dump)) | Raises `ParserSyntaxError` outside an Orchestration or Inline function, or for non-`Name` arguments |

**Key points:**

- All three are statement-only (cannot be used in expressions)
- `static_print` accepts variables, constants, string labels (printed as-is), and f-strings with plain `{expr}` placeholders (formatted as IR). Conversions (`!r`, `!s`, `!a`) and format specs (`:...`) are not supported.
- `static_assert` supports closure variable expressions (e.g. `N > 32`) and IR constants; message must be a string literal
- `dump_tag` takes one bare tensor variable name bound in the enclosing Orchestration (or Inline) scope; it is consumed at parse time and tracked by Var identity (not name) all the way to codegen. At an explicit `self.kernel(...)` site it records the tensor in the consuming Call's `dump_vars` on every subsequent consuming call; in the `@pl.jit` / `with pl.at(level=...)` style (where the dispatch is synthesised by the outline passes) it instead seeds the enclosing scope's `dump_vars` and the outliner maps it onto the synthesised dispatch arg (see [Runtime DFX](../03-runtime-dfx.md#selective-tensor-dump)). To list dump targets explicitly at a single task launch, use the `dumps=[...]` kwarg on `pl.submit(...)` / `pl.at(...)` (symmetric with `deps=`)
- Output appears even if parsing fails later — useful for debugging parse errors

Parameters can have `In` (default), `Out`, or `InOut` directions using wrapper types:

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
def kernel(
    qi: pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.BF16],                   # In (default)
    output: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]],      # InOut
    result: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]],        # Out
    scale: pl.Scalar[pl.FP32],                             # In (default)
) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
    ...
```

| Direction | Wrapper | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `In` | None (default) | Read-only input parameter |
| `Out` | `pl.Out[type]` | Write-only output parameter |
| `InOut` | `pl.InOut[type]` | Read-write input/output parameter |

**Constraint:** `Scalar` parameters cannot have `InOut` direction (raises `ParserTypeError`).

## Complete Example

### Tensor Operations (Loop with iter_args)

```python
# pypto.program: my_program
import pypto.language as pl

def loop_sum(n: pl.INT64) -> pl.INT64:
    sum_init: pl.INT64 = 0
    for i, (sum,) in pl.range(n, init_values=(sum_init,)):
        sum = pl.yield_(sum + i)
    return sum
```

### Tile Operations (Tile-based computation)

```python
import pypto.language as pl

@pl.program
class BlockExample:
    @pl.function
    def tile_add(
        self,
        input_a: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
        input_b: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
        output: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
    ) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32]:
        tile_a: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.load(input_a, [0, 0], [64, 64])
        tile_b: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.load(input_b, [0, 0], [64, 64])
        tile_c: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.add(tile_a, tile_b)
        result: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.store(tile_c, [0, 0], output)
        return result
```

## SSA-Style Control Flow

`pl.yield_()` creates SSA phi nodes for if/for statements:

```python
# If: phi node at merge point
if condition:
    y1 = pl.yield_(x + 1)
else:
    y1 = pl.yield_(x + 2)
# y1 = phi(x + 1, x + 2)

# For: loop-carried values via iter_args
sum_init: pl.INT64 = 0
for i, (sum,) in pl.range(10, init_values=(sum_init,)):
    sum = pl.yield_(sum + i)
sum_final: pl.INT64 = sum  # captures final value
```

## Cross-Module Function Reuse

Functions defined outside a `@pl.program` class can be reused via two mechanisms.

### External `@pl.function` Calls

An externally-defined `@pl.function` can be called by name inside `@pl.program`. The function is automatically added to the Program and an `ir.Call(GlobalVar, args)` is emitted.

```python
@pl.function
def softmax(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    ...

@pl.program
class MyModel:
    @pl.function
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = softmax(x)   # ir.Call(GlobalVar("softmax"), [x])
        return y
```

**Rules:**

- Uses the function's `.name` as GlobalVar (aliases are transparent)
- External and internal function names must not conflict
- Two different externals with the same `.name` is an error
- Same external called from multiple methods is added once

### `@pl.inline` Decorator

`@pl.inline` captures a function for statement-level inlining. No function is added to the Program — the body is expanded at each call site.

```python
@pl.inline
def normalize(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    result: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.mul(x, 2.0)
    return result

@pl.program
class MyModel:
    @pl.function
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = normalize(x)  # statements inlined in-place
        return y
```

**Rules:**

- Argument count must match parameter list exactly
- Closure variables from the inline definition site are available
- Inline functions can be called multiple times (each expansion is independent)
- Nested inline calls are supported

## Printing IR Nodes

Use `as_python()` on any IR node to get its Python representation:

```python
print(stmt.as_python())          # "x: pl.Scalar[pl.INT64] = a + b" (default "pl" prefix)
print(stmt.as_python("ir"))      # "x: ir.Scalar[ir.INT64] = a + b" (custom prefix)
```

### Concise Mode

Pass `concise=True` to omit intermediate type annotations. Function signature types (parameters and return) are always preserved:

```python
print(func.as_python())                  # verbose (default): type on every assignment
print(func.as_python(concise=True))      # concise: omits intermediate type annotations
```

Verbose output:

```python
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16]:
    y: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32] = pl.some_op(x)
    result: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16] = pl.cast(y, pl.FP16)
    return result
```

Concise output:

```python
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16]:
    y = pl.some_op(x)
    result = pl.cast(y, pl.FP16)
    return result
```

The free function `ir.python_print(node)` is also available and supports the same parameters.
