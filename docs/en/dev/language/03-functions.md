# Functions and Program Structure

Function declaration forms, parameter directions, cross-module reuse, and how to
print IR back to Python syntax.

## JIT constants and compilation reuse

A `@pl.jit` body is parsed into `@pl.program` source and re-parsed in a namespace
holding only `pl` and `pld`, so any name it inherits from its own module or an
enclosing function must be replaced, at its use site, by source text that
evaluates back to the same value. That covers literals (`int`, `float`, `bool`,
`str`, `None`), the `pl` dtype and enum constants (`pl.INT8`, `pl.Mem.Vec`,
`pl.PadValue.zero`, `pl.NZ`), and lists/tuples nested from those — a shape or a
rounding mode held in a constant, for instance. A value with no source form is
left alone, so the name survives and the parser reports it.

Every name that folds is also in the compilation key, including constants used by
transitive JIT helpers and source annotations. The key hashes the *emitted text*
for each name, straight from the function the specializer folds with, so the two
cannot drift: a constant that changes the generated source changes the key by
construction, and one that does not fold contributes nothing. Rebinding a
referenced constant causes a new specialization; changing an unrelated global or a
name shadowed by a body-local variable does not invalidate the body dependency
key.

```python
BLOCK = 32

@pl.jit
def slice_kernel(x: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[BLOCK, 128], pl.FP32]:
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):
        result = pl.slice(x, [BLOCK, 128], [0, 0])
    return result

first = slice_kernel.compile()
BLOCK = 64
second = slice_kernel.compile()  # A distinct specialization with 64 rows.
```

Name resolution, key construction, and specialization share a per-call namespace
snapshot. Constants rebound after capture affect the next call, not the artifact
being compiled. Each helper retains its own namespace, even when constants have
the same name. Rebinding a referenced JIT helper also refreshes the dependency
graph. Each concurrent call retains its captured graph throughout key construction
and specialization. The hash also includes each helper's function type, level, and
`auto_scope` setting, so rebinding an identically sourced function with different
compilation attributes cannot reuse the old artifact.

Each module's globals are copied once per request; helpers use closure overlays
on that shared snapshot. An empty closure cell still shadows a same-named global.
Validated graphs retain their Python source hashes, and declared layouts are
reused while their annotation bindings stay unchanged. External source files are
still checked on each request. Referenced closure constants are covered by the
source dependency hash without a separate closure-key component.

The snapshot copies bindings only: mutating arbitrary configuration objects
or editing compiler/source files during compilation is not supported by this
constant-tracking mechanism. Persistent reuse additionally requires the full
[artifact identity and cache policy](../10-jit-cache.md).

### Compile options and diagnostic requests

JIT calls and `kernel.compile()` resolve compile options before looking up an
in-process artifact. Omitting `config` uses the same defaults as `RunConfig()`:
`a2a3sim`, the default optimization strategy, and pass dumps disabled. Semantic
options (including the effective planner, runtime ABI, and source-location
emission controlled by `PYPTO_EMIT_PTO_LOC`) participate in the key. Runtime
controls such as `device_id`, `codegen_only`, and `save_kernels` alone do not.

The following requests compile afresh on every call, without reading or adding
an entry in the artifact cache:

- `dump_passes=True` or a dump level other than `PassDumpLevel.NONE`, and
  `dump_ptoas_passes=True`.
- `compile_profiling=True`, an active `CompileProfiler`, or profiling enabled
  through `PYPTO_COMPILE_PROFILING`.
- An explicit `save_kernels_dir`, or a nonempty `PYPTO_PROG_BUILD_DIR`.
- Explicit diagnostic settings, or an active `PassContext` with instruments
  or verification/diagnostic settings different from the pipeline defaults.

This ensures a warm kernel still emits requested dumps and reports. Repeating
a request regenerates the output; a failed diagnostic compile leaves ordinary
cached entries intact. Automatically allocated JIT output directories are unique
per compilation, so fresh diagnostics cannot overwrite a cached artifact.
Explicit output directories are used as requested. Diagnostic controls do not
split compilation keys.
Conflicting explicit settings and an active `PassContext` raise the same error
on cache hits as on fresh compilation. A plain planner/runtime context can
still reuse a matching cached artifact.

```python
from pypto.runtime import RunConfig

cached = slice_kernel.compile()
slice_kernel.compile(config=RunConfig(dump_passes=True, save_kernels_dir="debug_kernel"))
assert slice_kernel.compile() is cached
```

### Prepare binaries without executing

`kernel.warmup()` uses the same specialization, configuration, and in-process
object cache as `kernel.compile()`, and also prepares every kernel and
orchestration binary before returning. It initializes no NPU and creates no
runtime worker. The build host still needs the target compiler, SDK, and runtime
Python/native dependencies.

```python
import pypto.language as pl
from pypto.runtime import RunConfig

@pl.jit
def add_three(
    x: pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP32],
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP32]],
):
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):
        tile = pl.load(x, [0, 0], [16, 16])
        pl.store(pl.add(tile, 3.0), [0, 0], out)
    return out

config = RunConfig(platform="a2a3")
prepared = add_three.warmup(config=config)  # No sample tensor allocation.
# Later, on a host with an available NPU:
# prepared(x, out, config=config)
```

You can supply sample tensors as with `compile()`; warmup reads their metadata,
not their contents. With complete tensor annotations, omit the tensors and use
scalar defaults or keyword values. `pl.RUNTIME` keeps a scalar unspecialized in
annotation-driven mode, and dynamic extents retain the existing compile rules.
When calling the returned compiled object, supply its full parameter list,
including scalar arguments; JIT defaults are resolved during compilation.
Execution-only settings such as `codegen_only` do not suppress binary preparation.

The result is the same compiled object selected by `compile()`, with live IR
retained for fresh compilation. Warmup prepares every chip-level child of a
`DistributedCompiledProgram` and every orchestration sub-build of a
multi-orchestration `CompiledProgram`. It does not call the distributed object's
`prepare()`: that method creates a live worker for execution. Compilation errors
propagate to the caller; a failed binary build can be retried by calling warmup
again. Diagnostic/output requests still compile afresh as described above.

With [persistent caching](../10-jit-cache.md) enabled, warmup automatically
publishes or reuses READY artifacts through the [runtime protocol](../09-artifact-store.md).
Persistence is disabled by default. Read-only misses, unsupported inputs and
storage failures can prepare private results. A restored result has
`.program is None`; disable persistence or use `specialize()`/`lower()` to require IR.
The public cache policy, statistics and metadata-only warmup CLI are documented
in [Persistent JIT Cache](../10-jit-cache.md).

## Functions

```python
# Single return type
def function_name(param1: pl.INT64, param2: pl.FP32) -> pl.INT64:
    x: pl.INT64 = param1 + 1
    return x

# Multiple return types
def function_name(x: pl.INT64) -> tuple[pl.INT64, pl.INT64]:
    y: pl.INT64 = x + 1
    z: pl.INT64 = x * 2
    return y, z

# No return types
def function_name(x: pl.INT64):
    y: pl.INT64 = x + 1

# With function type
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
def orchestrator(n: pl.INT64) -> pl.INT64:
    return n + 1

@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
def aicore_kernel(x: pl.INT64) -> pl.INT64:
    return x * 2
```

### Function Types

| Type | Usage | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| `pl.FunctionType.Opaque` | Default | Unspecified function type |
| `pl.FunctionType.Orchestration` | Host/AICPU | Control flow and dependency analysis |
| `pl.FunctionType.InCore` | AICore | Sub-graph on specific AICore (unspecialized) |
| `pl.FunctionType.AIC` | Cube core | Cube core kernel (specialized InCore) |
| `pl.FunctionType.AIV` | Vector core | Vector core kernel (specialized InCore) |
| `pl.FunctionType.Group` | Multi-core | Co-scheduled group of AIC + AIV kernels |
| `pl.FunctionType.Graph` | Host/AICPU | Recordable orchestration fragment, replayed by the `host_build_graph` runtime (see below) |

When no type is specified, functions default to `Opaque`.

### Graph Fragments

`pl.FunctionType.Graph` marks a function as a recordable orchestration fragment.
Under the `host_build_graph` runtime each call site becomes one task launch that
the runtime records on the first call and replays afterwards, so N calls cost one
graph build instead of N:

```python
@pl.program
class Decoder:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Graph)
    def layer(self, cur, normed, next_hidden, wq, layer_base: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX]):
        ...

    @pl.function
    def decode(self, cur, normed, next_hidden, wq):
        for i in pl.range(40):
            self.layer(cur, normed, next_hidden, wq, i * 5120)
```

One Graph function is one recorded topology: the runtime identifies the recording
by the address of the emitted C++ function, so there is no cache key to name or
keep unique.

### Parameter Directions

Parameters can have `In` (default), `Out`, or `InOut` directions using wrapper types:

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
def kernel(
    qi: pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.BF16],                   # In (default)
    output: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]],      # InOut
    result: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]],        # Out
    scale: pl.Scalar[pl.FP32],                             # In (default)
) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
    ...
```

| Direction | Wrapper | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `In` | None (default) | Read-only input parameter |
| `Out` | `pl.Out[type]` | Write-only output parameter |
| `InOut` | `pl.InOut[type]` | Read-write input/output parameter |

**Constraint:** `Scalar` parameters cannot have `InOut` direction (raises `ParserTypeError`).

#### Writing an `Out` / `InOut` parameter

**A bare assignment does not write the parameter.** It rebinds the Python name:
the parameter Var is re-pointed at a freshly computed tensor and the caller's
buffer is left untouched. The program still compiles and runs. What the caller
gets back depends on the direction: an `Out` buffer is freshly allocated and
never initialised, so it reads as garbage; an `InOut` buffer still holds the
input the caller passed in, so the result is silently stale.

```python
out = pl.add(a, b)          # ❌ writes nothing
out[:] = pl.add(a, b)       # ✅ writes the whole tensor
```

Use the subscript form to write through the parameter:

| Spelling | Writes | Use when |
| -------- | ------ | -------- |
| `out[:] = <expr>` | the whole tensor | the result is the entire output |
| `out[<slices>] = <expr>` | that sub-window | writing part of the output |
| `out = pl.assemble(out, <expr>, <offset>)` | a window at `<offset>` | the explicit form the subscript sugar builds |
| `out = <expr>` | **nothing** | never — see the warning below |

Only the first and third are equivalent, and only when the slice covers the full
extent and `<offset>` is all zeros.

##### The `OutParamWriteDropped` warning

The compiler reports a bare assignment that drops the write:

```text
[warning] [OutParamWriteDropped] (pipeline_input) Assigning to Out parameter 'out'
in function 'main' rebinds the name only — the caller's buffer is never written.
Use 'out[:] = <expr>' to write the whole tensor, or 'out[<slices>] = <expr>' for
a sub-window. at repro.py:12:9
```

The check is data-flow based, not syntactic. A value can reach the parameter
without naming it — through a loop carry, for instance — and that is a genuine
write-through, so it stays silent:

```python
for col, (d,) in pl.range(0, n, chunk, init_values=(data,)):
    d = pl.store(local, [0, col], d)
    staged = pl.yield_(d)
data = pld.tensor.allreduce(staged, signal, ...)   # `staged` *is* `data`; no warning
```

The check is deliberately conservative: a value that merely *reads* the
parameter, such as `out = pl.add(out, b)`, is not reported even though it also
drops the write. Telling "reads the parameter" from "writes through the
parameter" needs per-op write semantics the operator registry does not record, and
a false warning on correct code costs more than a missed one. Write
`out[:] = pl.add(out, b)` when the whole tensor is meant.

Disable the check with `disabled_diagnostics` if it is not useful for your
program:

```python
disabled = passes.DiagnosticCheckSet()
disabled.insert(passes.DiagnosticCheck.OutParamWriteDropped)
ir.compile(program, disabled_diagnostics=disabled)
```

## How a `@pl.program` Class Is Located

`@pl.program` parses the class *body from source*, so it first has to find the
`class` statement that produced the decorated object. The class name alone does
not identify it: one function may define the same name in several branches, and
every one of them carries the same `__qualname__`.

The decorator resolves this from the line numbers of the methods in the class
body, so each branch is parsed from its own source:

```python
def make(case):
    if case == "add":
        @pl.program
        class Prog:                                # parsed from *this* body
            @pl.function
            def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]:
                return pl.add(x, 1.0)
        return Prog

    @pl.program
    class Prog:                                    # and this one from *this* body
        @pl.function
        def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]:
            return pl.mul(x, 3.0)
    return Prog
```

When the definitions genuinely cannot be told apart, the decorator raises a
`ParserSyntaxError` naming every candidate line rather than picking one — a
wrong pick would compile a body you never wrote. Give the classes distinct
names, or define the class once and vary it through a closure variable:

```python
def make(scale):
    @pl.program
    class Prog:                                    # one definition, parameterised
        @pl.function
        def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[8], pl.FP32]:
            return pl.mul(x, scale)
    return Prog
```

## Cross-Module Function Reuse

Functions defined outside a `@pl.program` class can be reused via two mechanisms.

### External `@pl.function` Calls

An externally-defined `@pl.function` can be called by name inside `@pl.program`. The function is automatically added to the Program and an `ir.Call(GlobalVar, args)` is emitted.

```python
@pl.function
def softmax(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    ...

@pl.program
class MyModel:
    @pl.function
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = softmax(x)   # ir.Call(GlobalVar("softmax"), [x])
        return y
```

**Rules:**

- Uses the function's `.name` as GlobalVar (aliases are transparent)
- External and internal function names must not conflict
- Two different externals with the same `.name` is an error
- Same external called from multiple methods is added once

### `@pl.inline` Decorator

`@pl.inline` captures a function for statement-level inlining. No function is added to the Program — the body is expanded at each call site.

```python
@pl.inline
def normalize(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    result: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.mul(x, 2.0)
    return result

@pl.program
class MyModel:
    @pl.function
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = normalize(x)  # statements inlined in-place
        return y
```

**Rules:**

- Argument count must match parameter list exactly
- Closure variables from the inline definition site are available
- Inline functions can be called multiple times (each expansion is independent)
- Nested inline calls are supported

## Complete Example

### Tensor Operations (Loop with iter_args)

```python
# pypto.program: my_program
import pypto.language as pl

def loop_sum(n: pl.INT64) -> pl.INT64:
    sum_init: pl.INT64 = 0
    for i, (sum,) in pl.range(n, init_values=(sum_init,)):
        sum = pl.yield_(sum + i)
    return sum
```

### Tile Operations (Tile-based computation)

```python
import pypto.language as pl

@pl.program
class BlockExample:
    @pl.function
    def tile_add(
        self,
        input_a: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
        input_b: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
        output: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
    ) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32]:
        tile_a: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.load(input_a, [0, 0], [64, 64])
        tile_b: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.load(input_b, [0, 0], [64, 64])
        tile_c: pl.Tile[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.add(tile_a, tile_b)
        result: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32] = pl.store(tile_c, [0, 0], output)
        return result
```

## Printing IR Nodes

Use `as_python()` on any IR node to get its Python representation:

```python
print(stmt.as_python())          # "x: pl.Scalar[pl.INT64] = a + b" (default "pl" prefix)
print(stmt.as_python("ir"))      # "x: ir.Scalar[ir.INT64] = a + b" (custom prefix)
```

### Concise Mode

Pass `concise=True` to omit intermediate type annotations. Function signature types (parameters and return) are always preserved:

```python
print(func.as_python())                  # verbose (default): type on every assignment
print(func.as_python(concise=True))      # concise: omits intermediate type annotations
```

Verbose output:

```python
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16]:
    y: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32] = pl.some_op(x)
    result: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16] = pl.cast(y, pl.FP16)
    return result
```

Concise output:

```python
def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.FP16]:
    y = pl.some_op(x)
    result = pl.cast(y, pl.FP16)
    return result
```

The free function `ir.python_print(node)` is also available and supports the same parameters.
