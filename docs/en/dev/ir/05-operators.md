# Operator System

Type-safe operator definitions with automatic type deduction, organized into modular categories (TensorOp, TileOp, SyncOp, CrossCoreOp).

## Operator Categories

| Category | Types | Use Case | File Location |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | ------------- |
| **TensorOp** | TensorType | N-D tensor operations with broadcasting | `src/ir/op/tensor_ops/` |
| **TileOp** | TileType | Hardware-optimized tile operations | `src/ir/op/tile_ops/` |
| **BufferOp** | BufferType, VoidType | Internal explicit storage and destination writes | `src/ir/op/buffer_ops/` |
| **SyncOp** | UnknownType (barriers); ScalarType (task / launch queries) | Pipeline barriers, synchronization, TaskId and SPMD launch-shape queries | `src/ir/op/sync_ops/` |
| **CrossCoreOp** | UnknownType/TileType | AIC↔AIV cross-core communication | `src/ir/op/sync_ops/cross_core.cpp` |
| **PrefetchOp** | Opaque handles | Asynchronous GM→L2 cache prefetch | `src/ir/op/prefetch/prefetch_async.cpp` |

**Key Features**: Fluent API, automatic type deduction, kwargs for metadata, NumPy-style broadcasting, type promotion, dynamic dimensions (`kDynamicDim`)

The internal Buffer-stage GM and addition operations have no public DSL wrappers:

| Operation | Positional operands | Result |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| `buffer.load` | GM tensor, offsets tuple, valid extents tuple, destination buffer | Void |
| `buffer.store` | source buffer, offsets tuple, valid extents tuple, GM tensor | Void |
| `buffer.add` | lhs buffer, rhs buffer, destination buffer | Void |

These use separate data/metadata effects. See [Buffer contracts](02-types.md#buffer-operator-contracts)
for shape, dtype, valid-state, and alias requirements.

## Type System

```cpp
// Dynamic dimensions (pypto/core/common.h)
constexpr int64_t kDynamicDim = -1;
auto dynamic_dim = make_int(kDynamicDim);
```

| Type | Dimensions | Use Case | Memory |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| **TensorType** | N-D | General tensors, function params/returns | DDR (optional MemRef) |
| **TileType** | N-D | Hardware-optimized tiles in unified buffers | Unified buffer (optional MemRef) |
| **ScalarType** | 0D | Scalar values | Register |
| **UnknownType** | N/A | No return value (sync ops) | N/A |

## REGISTER_OP Fluent API

| Method | Purpose | Example |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `set_op_category(str)` | Operator category | `.set_op_category("TensorOp")` |
| `set_description(str)` | Human-readable description | `.set_description("Element-wise add")` |
| `add_argument(name, desc)` | Positional Expr argument | `.add_argument("lhs", "Left tensor")` |
| `no_argument()` | No arguments (sync ops) | `.no_argument()` |
| `set_attr<T>(name)` | Kwarg schema (T: bool, int, DataType, etc.) | `.set_attr<bool>("a_trans")` |
| `f_deduce_type(fn)` | Type deduction function | `.f_deduce_type(DeduceAddType)` |

| `set_arg_effect(i, fn)` | Same, when a kwarg decides it | `.set_arg_effect(2, [](const auto& kw) { ... })` |
| `no_arg_writes()` | Classified: writes through no argument | `.no_arg_writes()` |
| `set_write_channel(c)` | Hardware path the op's writes take | `.set_write_channel(WriteChannel::Dma)` |
| `set_output_arity(N)` | Values produced; `N > 1` means a `TupleType` result — see [Multi-Output Operators](09-multi_output_ops.md) | `.set_output_arity(2)` |
| `set_workspace_arg(i)` | Argument `i` is compiler-supplied scratch, not a result | `.set_workspace_arg(2)` |

### Argument effects

See [Operator effects](10-operator-effects.md) for argument access declarations,
write channels, and core placement/replication contracts. Buffer-stage effects
are described in [Buffer contracts](02-types.md#buffer-operator-contracts).

**Type Deduction Signature:**

```cpp
std::function<TypePtr(const std::vector<ExprPtr>& args,
                      const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::any>>& kwargs)>
```

## C++ Registration Examples

### Simple Elementwise Operator

```cpp
// src/ir/op/tensor_ops/elementwise.cpp
REGISTER_OP("tensor.add")
    .set_op_category("TensorOp")
    .add_argument("lhs", "Left tensor")
    .add_argument("rhs", "Right tensor")
    .f_deduce_type([](const std::vector<ExprPtr>& args,
                      const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::any>>& kwargs) {
      CHECK(args.size() == 2);
      auto t1 = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const TensorType>(args[0]->GetType());
      auto t2 = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const TensorType>(args[1]->GetType());
      auto dtype = PromoteDataTypes(t1->dtype_, t2->dtype_);
      auto shape = BroadcastShapes(t1->shape_, t2->shape_);
      return std::make_shared<TensorType>(shape.shape, *dtype);
    });
```

### Operator with Kwargs

```cpp
// src/ir/op/tensor_ops/matmul.cpp
TypePtr DeduceMatMul(const std::vector<ExprPtr>& args,
                     const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::any>>& kwargs) {
  auto lhs = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const TensorType>(args[0]->GetType());
  auto rhs = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const TensorType>(args[1]->GetType());

  auto get = [&](const std::string& k, bool d) {
    for (const auto& [name, val] : kwargs)
      if (name == k) return std::any_cast<bool>(val);
    return d;
  };

  DataType dtype = [&]() {
    for (const auto& [k, v] : kwargs)
      if (k == "out_dtype") return static_cast<DataType>(std::any_cast<int>(v));
    return *PromoteDataTypes(lhs->dtype_, rhs->dtype_);
  }();

  bool a_t = get("a_trans", false), b_t = get("b_trans", false);
  ExprPtr m = a_t ? lhs->shape_[1] : lhs->shape_[0];
  ExprPtr n = b_t ? rhs->shape_[0] : rhs->shape_[1];
  return std::make_shared<TensorType>(std::vector<ExprPtr>{m, n}, dtype);
}

REGISTER_OP("tensor.matmul")
    .set_op_category("TensorOp")
    .add_argument("lhs", "Left matrix")
    .add_argument("rhs", "Right matrix")
    .set_attr<DataType>("out_dtype")
    .set_attr<bool>("a_trans")
    .set_attr<bool>("b_trans")
    .f_deduce_type(DeduceMatMul);
```

For 2D `tile.matmul`, the physical boxed K dimensions must match. PTO derives
the contraction extent from the lhs valid K, so that extent may be smaller than
the rhs valid K but must be contained by it. `tile.matmul_acc` likewise keeps
exact physical M/N/K box compatibility while allowing the accumulator's valid
M/N rectangle and the rhs valid K extent to contain the smaller rectangle PTO
computes from lhs M/K and rhs N.

#### Conditional accumulator initialization (`init_cond`)

`tile.matmul_acc`, `tile.batch_matmul_acc`, `tensor.matmul_acc`, and
`tile.gemv_acc` take an optional fourth operand, `init_cond`: a BOOL scalar that
selects, per execution, whether the accumulator is *overwritten* with
`lhs @ rhs` or accumulated into. It is the split-K `k == 0` idiom, and it removes
the need either to zero the accumulator or to peel the first K step:

```python
acc = pl.tile.create([16, N], pl.INT32, target_memory=pl.Mem.Acc)
for k0 in pl.pipeline(0, K, K_TILE, stage=2):
    ...
    acc = pl.tile.matmul_acc(acc, a_left, b_right, init_cond=(k0 == 0))
```

The predicate's domain is exactly `matmul_acc`'s own: any operand shape that
accumulates without a predicate accumulates with one. A `tensor.matmul_acc` with
an operand of rank > 2 converts to `tile.batch_matmul_acc`, which forwards
`init_cond` verbatim to every 2D `tile.matmul_acc` that `FlattenTileNdTo2D`
unrolls it into — each of those is the sole writer of its own row band of the
accumulator, so the predicate applies band by band. (Only `batch_count == 1`
reaches codegen today; a larger batch is rejected in `FlattenTileNdTo2D` for a
reason unrelated to the predicate — the per-batch accumulator would be a strided
L0C row window, which the MAD cannot address.)

The predicate is a positional operand rather than a registry kwarg because it
may be loop-dependent; kwargs carry only compile-time constants. Registering it
as an operand also means it participates in the use-def chain like any other
SSA value.

Being an operand, it prints positionally at the tile layer —
`pl.tile.matmul_acc(acc, lhs, rhs, k0 == 0)`. Two signatures already spend
positional slot 4 (`a_trans` at the tensor layer, `acc_phase` on GEMV), so there
the printer emits it as a keyword — and `init_cond` is correspondingly
keyword-only in those DSL signatures. Every printed form reparses to the same IR:

`pl.tensor.matmul_acc(acc, lhs, rhs, init_cond=k0 == 0, a_trans=False, b_trans=False)`
`pl.tile.gemv_acc(acc, lhs, rhs, init_cond=k0 == 0, acc_phase=pl.AccPhase.Unspecified)`

Lowering depends on whether the predicate is known at compile time:

| `init_cond` | Emitted |
| ----------- | ------- |
| absent, or literal `False` | `pto.tmatmul.acc ins(dst, lhs, rhs) outs(dst)` |
| literal `True` | `pto.tmatmul ins(lhs, rhs) outs(dst)` |
| runtime predicate | `scf.if cond { pto.tmatmul } else { pto.tmatmul.acc }` |

`tile.gemv_acc` lowers through the same emitter with `pto.tgemv.acc` /
`pto.tgemv` substituted — GEMV is a matmul whose M is 1, run on the same cube
MAD, so it carries the same `cmatrixInit` bit. Its `acc_phase` attribute rides on
whichever arm is emitted.

The ISA carries this as bit 63 (`cmatrixInit`) of the MAD's Xt register, so the
hardware needs no branch; `pto.tmatmul` and `pto.tmatmul.acc` are distinct ops
with no init operand, hence the branch. Because `matmul_acc` is in place
(`set_output_reuses_input(0)`), both arms write the same buffer and the `scf.if`
yields no value — no phi is materialized on the Acc tile.

"Literal" covers **both** spellings a constant predicate arrives in: a DSL
`init_cond=True`/`False` reaches the emitter as a BOOL-typed `ConstInt`, while a
predicate an earlier pass folded reaches it as a `ConstBool` — which is what the
generated `ko == 0` becomes when [`LowerPipelineLoops`](../passes/32-lower_pipeline_loops.md)
replicates the K-loop *and* the enclosing loop is eliminated, so each replica's
index is a literal. Both pick an arm outright, and an emitter that folded only
one of the two would double the MADs of every K block it missed.

The fold is therefore conditional on the trip count, not universal: at
`16x512x64` the pipelined loop disappears and the emitted PTO has no `scf.if`,
while at `16x2048x64` the replica indices stay symbolic (`ko`, `ko + 256`) and
two `scf.if`s survive. That is not a regression — the peeled `IfStmt` this
replaced produced the same two branches for those shapes.

The compiler uses the idiom it recommends: `AutoTileMatmulL0` *emits* the
predicated form for the K-loop of a plain `tile.matmul`, so the `tile.create`
seed, the loop-carried value and the loop's `return_var` share one L0C buffer
by construction. `tile.matmul_bias` carries no `init_cond` operand, so it cannot
use the predicated body; its first K block is *head-peeled* out of the loop
instead, applying the bias exactly once and minting the accumulator that the
remaining blocks accumulate into. That reaches the same one-buffer chain without
a predicate, so the pass no longer generates an accumulator phi at all.

One limitation, diagnosed rather than silently dropped:

- **`batch_count > 1` is rejected.** Not because of the predicate — this shape
  fails identically without one. `FlattenTileNdTo2D` gives each batch a
  `tile.slice` of the accumulator, and a row window of a multi-block-column
  L0C tile is strided, which the MAD cannot address (pto-isa#253). Rank > 2 is
  fine as long as the batch dims multiply to 1, which is the grouped-GEMM case
  (`[1, N, K]` weights). For a genuine batch, loop over the batch dimension
  instead.

An oversized *predicated* `tile.matmul_acc` is K-tiled like the unpredicated
one: the caller's predicate is ANDed with the emitted loop's own `ko == 0`, and
the peeled partial tail keeps the unpredicated 3-operand form (it is never the
first K block).

M/N tiling of an accumulate is available only at *loop* level, and equally for
both spellings: a `tile.create([M, N])` / split-K `pl.pipeline` / one-2D-store
triplet is tiled outside its K loop whether the reduction is peeled
(`if ko == 0: matmul else: matmul_acc`) or predicated
(`matmul_acc(acc, lhs, rhs, ko == 0)`). Outside that shape — a standalone
oversized `tile.matmul_acc` on a caller-owned `[M, N]` accumulator, or a
predicated one whose `init_cond` is not a seed test on the loop's induction
variable — slicing the accumulator is unsupported and the pass says so with a
`PH-AT-006` perf hint.

At the tile layer, `tile.batch_matmul` provides batched semantics for
`TileType` operands. It accepts rank >= 2 tiles, broadcasts the leading batch
dimensions, and keeps the same operand-only interface style as `tile.matmul`.
If batch operands need transpose semantics, that can be expressed either with
an explicit `tile.transpose(...)` on the inputs or by a zero-copy
`tile.transpose_view(...)` over a natural `tile.load`. During later lowering to
2D `tile.matmul`, both forms are normalized to the same operand-transpose
semantics.

`tile.batch_matmul_acc(acc, lhs, rhs)` is the accumulating counterpart for
the batched path: `acc = acc + lhs @ rhs` with the same rank>=2 + batch
broadcasting rules as `tile.batch_matmul`. The acc batch shape must match the
broadcast batch shape of `lhs`/`rhs` exactly; the matmul (M, N) dims must
match the trailing dims of acc; and the K dimension must match between lhs
and rhs. The inner accumulator type defaults to FP32 for floating inputs and
INT32 for integer inputs (mirroring `tile.matmul_acc`). At conversion time
`ConvertTensorToTileOps` dispatches `tensor.matmul` / `tensor.matmul_acc` to
this batched path whenever any operand has rank > 2; `FlattenTileNdTo2D`
later unrolls the batched form into per-batch 2D ops.

### MX block-scale matmul (Ascend950)

MX uses dedicated `LeftScale` / `RightScale` memory spaces and the `FP8E8M0`
scale dtype. PyPTO supports host-prequant MXFP8 and an explicit FP4×FP8 conversion path on Ascend950 through
the `matmul_mx` family. `InsertMxScaleAddr` (after `InferTileMemorySpace`)
inserts the internal `tile.tget_scale_addr` bindings once operand memory
spaces are resolved.

| IR / DSL | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| `tile.load` of `pl.Tensor[..., pl.MX_A_ZZ \| pl.MX_B_NN]` | The source TensorLayout carries the MX scale GM layout. Dtype is FP8E8M0, and strided sources are rejected. Public `pl.load` defaults an omitted target to `Mat`; raw IR must carry `target_memory=Mat`. |
| `tile.move(..., target_memory=LeftScale/RightScale)` | Mat-to-Scale move with hardware-fixed row/row/32 (left) or col/col/32 (right) layout; the source Mat tile and layout overrides must match exactly. |
| `tile.create(..., target_memory=LeftScale/RightScale)` | Not supported; load MX scale data into Mat and then move it into scale memory. |
| `tile.matmul_mx` / `pl.matmul_mx` | `Left, LeftScale, Right, RightScale → Acc`; operand positions drive automatic placement, including Vec→Mat→LeftScale/RightScale staging for `quant_mx` scales. Both data operands reaching the op must be `FP8E4M3FN`, and scale is `FP8E8M0`; `lhs_scale` and `rhs_scale` must be distinct tiles. Native FP4 data is **not supported** (see [FP4](../fp4.md)). Physical `M % 16 == 0`, `K % 64 == 0`, and `N % 32 == 0`; valid K must satisfy `ceil(validK/32) == ceil(physicalK/32)`. Alignment / scale-group checks run only for constant extents; symbolic dims skip the numeric checks and fall back to the declared scale tile geometry (later PTOAS still verifies). |
| `tile.matmul_mx_acc` / `pl.matmul_mx_acc` | `Acc, Left, LeftScale, Right, RightScale → Acc`; in-place through `set_output_reuses_input(0)`; accumulator physical and valid M/N must match the matmul output. |
| `tile.matmul_mx_bias` / `pl.matmul_mx_bias` | `Left, LeftScale, Right, RightScale, Bias → Acc`; bias is `[1, N]` FP32. |
| `tile.tget_scale_addr` | Compiler-generated A5 binding from `LeftScale↔Left` or `RightScale↔Right`; DPS in-place on `dst_scale`. Users write only the `matmul_mx` family. |

The canonical shape is `M=128, K=64, N=64`, with FP8E4M3FN data,
FP8E8M0 scales shaped `[128,2]` and `[2,64]`, and `mx_a_zz` / `mx_b_nn`
host layouts. Align M↑16, K↑64, and N↑32.

MX tensor subviews are a legacy limitation. `tensor.slice`, `tensor.reshape`,
`tensor.transpose`, `tensor.reinterpret_view`, and ordinary MX `tensor.view`
reject MX-layout sources because the hardware path cannot represent a subview
base offset. The one exception is a product-preserving FP8E8M0 shaped alias
between packed ND backing and `MX_A_ZZ` / `MX_B_NN` (used for GM staging).
`pld.tile.remote_load` also rejects MX layouts until its complete scale layout
contract is implemented. `tensor.gather_row` / `tile.gather_row` likewise reject
MX sources.

FP4 packing, cast policy, distributed / matmul limits, and TODOs: see
[FP4](../fp4.md). Native FP4 `matmul_mx` data is unsupported; `pl.quant_mx` is
MXFP8-only.

#### MX / Ascend950: pto-isa constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Distinct scale buffers | Cube does not fold scales into Left/Right data. `TileType::ScaleLeft` / `ScaleRight` sidecars map to PyPTO `LeftScale` / `RightScale`. |
| Payload | Scale is `float8_e8m0_t` / `FP8E8M0`; the emitted MX data pair is `FP8E4M3FN × FP8E4M3FN` (rejects `FP8E5M2` and native packed FP4). Physical `K%64==0` and fractal is 32. |
| Layouts | `mx_a_zz` is row-major ZZ; `mx_b_nn` is col-major NN; loads use `TLoadMxCube*` (AZZ2ZZ). |
| `TMov` `CommonCheckMX` | Allows UINT8 Mat → FP8E8M0 ScaleLeft/Right; canonical path: ui8 Mat reshape then ui8→f8 Scale. |
| Bind then fill | Fill **after** `GetScaleAddr(Left/Right)`; writing the provisional alloc address is orphaned once rebound. |
| Alignment | Post-cast FP8 tile extents require physical `M%16==0`, `K%64==0`, and `N%32==0`; `DeduceTileMatMulMxType` enforces these for **constant** extents only. Symbolic dims skip numeric checks. |

#### MX / Ascend950: PTOAS constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Single `loc=scaling` | PTOAS has no distinct left/right scale locations; EmitC recovers ScaleLeft/Right. |
| FP8E8M0 scaling dtype | UINT8 with `loc=scaling` is treated as Fixpipe scaling, so promote before entering LeftScale/RightScale. |
| No Mat↔Scaling `treshape` | Different locs; reshape stays in Mat (ui8), then `tmov` into scaling. |
| Shape-matched Mat→Scale `tmov` | Flat `[1,G]` must `treshape` to `[M,K/32]` (or B-side shape) first. |
| Order | PyPTO emits Mat→scaling `tmov` in source order; PTOAS `PTOA5NormalizeTMovPass` reorders `tget_scale_addr` before it (ISA bind-then-fill). |
| `#pto.layout` / mx load | `mx_a_zz` / `mx_b_nn` / …; codegen emits logical rank-2 `make_tensor_view` (PTOAS v0.60 InferPTOLayout / EmitC map the pack). |
| Coverage | `pto.tmatmul.mx` / `.acc` / `.bias` + `pto.tget_scale_addr`; `pto.tquant.mx` via [LowerCompositeOps](../passes/14-lower_composite_ops.md). |

### Tile-only GEMV family (A2/A3)

The tile-only GEMV family uses logical shape `[1, N]` but follows the Cube
instruction's padded physical contract. Its Acc result has 16 physical rows,
while its physical column count follows the RHS tile (and must satisfy the
target's normal C0 alignment); the bias uses the same physical column count.
Their `valid_shape` retains the logical `[K, N]`, `[1, N]`, and `[1, N]`
regions. The lhs must have exactly one physical and logical row. A single-row Mat load uses `blayout=row_major` and
`slayout=none_box`, selecting PTO-ISA's row-vector extraction path.

The rhs logical K must cover the lhs logical K. Supported dtype triples
are `INT8 x INT8 -> INT32` and same-type `FP16`, `BF16`, or `FP32` inputs to
`FP32`; `gemv_acc` uses that output dtype for `acc`, and `gemv_bias` requires
the same output dtype for `bias`. The bias valid shape must cover the logical
output shape `[1, N]`; its valid N may be wider when the physical N matches.

`tile.gemv`, `tile.gemv_acc`, and `tile.gemv_bias` accept `acc_phase` as
`pl.AccPhase.Unspecified` (the default), `pl.AccPhase.Partial`, or
`pl.AccPhase.Final`. Use `Partial` while more K chunks remain and `Final` for
the last chunk.

`tile.gemv_acc` additionally takes the optional `init_cond` predicate — see
[Conditional accumulator initialization](#conditional-accumulator-initialization-init_cond).
`tile.gemv_bias` carries none, mirroring `tile.matmul_bias`: a biased GEMV
already mints its accumulator, so it has no initial value to predicate.

The padded Acc contract shapes how a predicated split-K GEMV mints that
accumulator. Because a `[1, N]` result occupies 16 physical rows,
`pl.tile.create([1, N], ...)` is rejected on physical shape and `[16, N]` on
valid shape; create at the physical shape and narrow the valid rectangle:

```python
acc_raw = pl.tile.create([16, N], pl.FP32, target_memory=pl.Mem.Acc)
acc = pl.tile.set_validshape(acc_raw, 1, N)  # then gemv_acc(..., init_cond=(k0 == 0))
```

Before `init_cond`, the peel did this implicitly — a straight-line `pl.tile.gemv`
mints a correctly typed accumulator, at the cost of a phi between the branches.

On a unit-flag-aware path, the final accumulator producer must be paired with
`pl.store(..., st_phase=pl.STPhase.Final)`. The final producer sets the unit flag
and the final store checks and clears it; a plain store intentionally keeps the
default `pl.STPhase.Unspecified` behavior. PyPTO does not expose PTO-ISA's
check-only store phase because that phase requires an ordered multi-consumer
lifecycle. Compilation verifies the supported final pairing in both directions:
bind the final producer's result and store that exact value in the same
straight-line control-flow region. A missing or mismatched pair is rejected
before code generation because it can otherwise stall device execution.

## Python Usage

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import DataType, ir
from pypto.ir import op

span = ir.Span.unknown()
dim4, dim8 = ir.ConstInt(4, DataType.INT32, span), ir.ConstInt(8, DataType.INT32, span)

# Create tensors
tensor_a = ir.Var("a", ir.TensorType([dim4, dim8], DataType.FP32), span)
tensor_b = ir.Var("b", ir.TensorType([dim8], DataType.FP32), span)

# Simple operators
result = op.tensor.add(tensor_a, tensor_b)  # Broadcasting: [4,8] + [8] → [4,8]

# Operators with kwargs
dim64, dim128 = ir.ConstInt(64, DataType.INT32, span), ir.ConstInt(128, DataType.INT32, span)
a = ir.Var("a", ir.TensorType([dim64, dim128], DataType.FP16), span)
b = ir.Var("b", ir.TensorType([dim128, dim64], DataType.FP16), span)
matmul = op.tensor.matmul(a, b, out_dtype=DataType.FP32, a_trans=True)

# Query registry
assert ir.is_op_registered("tensor.add")
op_instance = ir.get_op("tensor.add")
```

## Kwargs (Keyword Arguments)

Call expressions separate Expr arguments from metadata parameters using kwargs.

### Kwargs vs Args vs Attributes

| - | **Args** | **Kwargs** | **Op Attributes** |
| - | -------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Type** | `ExprPtr` | `std::any` | Type-erased |
| **Scope** | Per-Call | Per-Call | Global |
| **Use** | Tensors, dims, offsets | `out_dtype`, flags, modes | Device, category |
| **Access** | `call.args_` | `call.kwargs_` | `op.get_attr()` |

### C++ - Reading Kwargs

```cpp
TypePtr DeduceCastType(const std::vector<ExprPtr>& args,
                       const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::any>>& kwargs) {
  auto input = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const TensorType>(args[0]->GetType());

  // `kwargs` is a vector of pairs, not a map — scan it to look a key up.
  auto find_kwarg = [&kwargs](const std::string& key) {
    return std::find_if(kwargs.begin(), kwargs.end(),
                        [&key](const auto& kv) { return kv.first == key; });
  };

  // Required kwargs — `cast` declares both `target_type` and `mode`, and codegen
  // reads `mode` unconditionally, so a missing one must fail here rather than
  // silently default to round_mode NONE.
  auto it = find_kwarg("target_type");
  CHECK(it != kwargs.end()) << "tensor.cast requires 'target_type'";
  DataType target = static_cast<DataType>(std::any_cast<int>(it->second));

  CHECK(find_kwarg("mode") != kwargs.end()) << "tensor.cast requires 'mode'";

  return std::make_shared<TensorType>(input->shape_, target);
}
```

A genuinely optional kwarg (one codegen reads with a fallback, such as `tile.log`'s
`high_precision`) is read via `Call::GetKwarg<T>(key, default_value)` instead of a
`CHECK` — see `include/pypto/ir/expr.h`.

### Python - Using Kwargs

```python
result = op.tensor.matmul(a, b, out_dtype=DataType.FP32, a_trans=True)
print(result.kwargs)  # {'out_dtype': 51, 'a_trans': True}
```

## Broadcasting and Type Promotion

### NumPy-style Broadcasting

Dimensions aligned right to left:

```text
[4, 8] + [4, 8] → [4, 8]  # Exact match
[4, 8] + [8]    → [4, 8]  # Missing left dimension = 1
[4, 1] + [8]    → [4, 8]  # Size 1 broadcasts
[1, 8] + [4, 8] → [4, 8]  # Size 1 broadcasts
[4, 8] + [5]    → Error   # 8 ≠ 5
```

### Type Promotion

Standard numeric rules: float > int, larger > smaller, signed > unsigned (same size).

```text
INT32 + INT32 → INT32
INT32 + FP32  → FP32   (float precedence)
INT32 + INT64 → INT64  (larger size)
UINT32 + INT32 → INT32 (signed precedence)
```

## SyncOp: Synchronization Operations

**Purpose**: Hardware synchronization and barriers, plus the TaskId and SPMD launch-shape queries sharing the `system.` namespace
**Type**: `UnknownType` (no return, used in `EvalStmt`) for barriers; `ScalarType` for the value-binding query ops (`task_invalid`, `task_is_valid`, `available_cluster_count`, `available_aiv_count`)
**Location**: `src/ir/op/sync_ops/` — `sync.cpp` (barriers), `task.cpp` (TaskId), `launch.cpp` (launch-shape queries)
**Python API**: `from pypto.ir.op import system`

| Operation | Description | Kwargs |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `system.bar_all` | Global barrier (lowers to `pto.barrier <PIPE_ALL>`) | None |
| `system.bar_v` | Vector barrier (lowers to `pto.barrier <PIPE_V>`) | None |
| `system.bar_m` | Matrix barrier (lowers to `pto.barrier <PIPE_M>`) | None |
| `system.fence` | Memory barrier over global memory (lowers to `pto.fence.barrier_all #pto.fence_scope<gm>`) | None |
| `system.cacheinvalid` | Invalidate the cache line containing a tensor sub-region's base address. Args: `tensor`, `shapes` (N-D), `offsets` (N-D). Every region size — a single element included — lowers to `pto.partition_view` + `pto.cmo.cacheinvalid %payload_view single_cache_line : !pto.partition_tensor_view<...>`; `shapes` does not make it walk every cache line. The no-argument form invalidates all GM. | None |
| `system.syncall` | Cross-core all-participant barrier (`pto::SYNCALL`). Attr `mode` `"hard"` (FFTS, no operands) or `"soft"` (GM-polling, operands) | `core_type` (`"aiv_only"` \| `"aic_only"` \| `"mix"`), `mode` (`"hard"` \| `"soft"`) |
| `system.sync_src` | Set sync flag | `set_pipe`, `wait_pipe`, `event_id` |
| `system.sync_dst` | Wait sync flag | `set_pipe`, `wait_pipe`, `event_id` |
| `system.task_invalid` | Sentinel `TaskId::invalid()` — "no producer" seed for a TaskId carry | None |
| `system.task_is_valid` | Test whether a `TASK_ID` value is a valid (non-sentinel) handle | None; sole positional arg is the TaskId Var |
| `system.available_cluster_count` | This run's MIX cluster (= AIC) count, read from the device. Result `Scalar[INT32]` | None |
| `system.available_aiv_count` | This run's standalone AIV core count, read from the device. Result `Scalar[INT32]` | None |

`system.syncall` has two modes, selected by its `mode` **IR attribute**; the Python surfaces spell them as `pl.SyncAllMode` members instead (see below). The **hard** form (attr `"hard"`, the default) emits an FFTS barrier that waits for **all** physical cores of the selected `core_type`; the kernel must be launched at full occupancy (one block per physical core) **and with `sync_start=True`** (so all blocks are co-resident — a non-sync_start launch may dispatch blocks in waves and deadlock the barrier), or it deadlocks (AICore error 507018). The **soft** form (attr `"soft"`) polls a shared GM workspace and so works at **partial** occupancy. `gm_workspace` is a shared, zero-initialized GM `INT32` tensor containing at least 16 elements (64 bytes). Pass it as a kernel parameter so all blocks share one buffer; it must occupy an exclusive cache line and be zero-initialized before its first use.

The current PTO-ISA uses the same soft operand ABI for every `core_type`: `[gm_workspace]` derives the participant count from the device launch configuration, while `[gm_workspace, used_cores]` supplies it explicitly as a Python integer in the INT32 range or an `INT32` scalar. The high-level DSL requires `used_cores` to make that choice explicit: pass a positive count for the two-operand form, or explicitly pass `0` for the one-operand form. For `mix`, an explicit count is the total number of AIC and AIV participants. Runtimes whose logical grid differs from the device launch registers must use a positive explicit count; this includes the currently pinned Simpler runtime. No UB/L1 scratch tile is required.

Both modes guarantee barrier arrival only. They do not wait for preceding data instructions such as `TSTORE`, and they do not publish or invalidate business-data cache lines. For a cross-core GM handoff that may span multiple cache lines, conservatively publish the producer's writes with whole-GM `system.cacheinvalid()` and `system.fence` before the barrier, then use whole-GM `system.cacheinvalid()` on the consumer before it reads. The tensor-region form invalidates only the cache line containing the view's base address.

The `core_type` and `mode` attributes stay strings **in the IR**, but the Python surfaces are enum-typed: `pl.KernelType` (`AIC` / `AIV` / `MIX`, naming which generated kernel the op belongs to) and `pl.SyncAllMode` (`HARD` / `SOFT`). Only members are accepted: the lowered attr spelling is an output, not an input, so passing one is a `TypeError`, and a member outside an op's own domain is a `ValueError`. The unified `mode=` keyword API is the **DSL** surface (`pl.system.syncall`). The Python IR helpers under `pypto.ir.op.system` are split instead: `syncall(core_type=...)` builds the hard form and `syncall_soft(core_type, gm_workspace, used_cores=None)` builds the soft form.

`system.available_cluster_count` / `system.available_aiv_count` are the SPMD **launch-shape queries**: pass one as `pl.spmd(...)`'s `core_num` so the launch sizes itself on the device the run lands on. Orchestration codegen lowers them to `rt_available_cluster_count()` / `rt_available_aiv_count()`. Use the cluster count for a mixed (AIC+AIV) or cube-only kernel — one block per core-group — and the AIV count for a vector-only kernel. This is the only launch width that stays at full occupancy across devices, which the hard `system.syncall` requires; the `HardSyncallOccupancy` verifier accepts these widths without a count comparison and rejects the query for the *other* core type. Pass the call inline (`pl.spmd(pl.system.available_cluster_count())`) rather than binding it to a name first — a name reaches the outlined `Spmd` wrapper as a variable defined in the caller, which the IR printer cannot re-parse. Source: `src/ir/op/sync_ops/launch.cpp`.

`system.task_invalid` returns [`ScalarType(DataType::TASK_ID)`](02-types.md#scalartype). It is the lowering target of the Python literal `None` when `None` appears in a TaskId position (a `deps=[None]` entry or a TaskId loop iter_arg seed) inside `with pl.manual_scope():` regions. There is no `system.task_id_of` op — producer task ids are obtained from the second tuple element returned by the `pl.submit(...)` parser construct, not from a builtin. Source: `src/ir/op/sync_ops/task.cpp`.

## CrossCoreOp: AIC↔AIV Communication

**Purpose**: Cross-core synchronization, data transfer, and pipe management between AIC (Cube) and AIV (Vector) kernels
**Type**: `UnknownType` (sync/push/init/buffer/free ops) or `TileType` passthrough (pop ops)
**Location**: `src/ir/op/tile_ops/cross_core.cpp` (tpush/tpop) and `src/ir/op/sync_ops/cross_core.cpp` (sync/tfree/pipe init/buffers)
**Python API**: `import pypto.language as pl` (promoted ops) or `from pypto.ir.op import tile, system`

### Explicit Event Synchronization

| Operation | Args | Description | Kwargs |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `system.sync_set` | 0 or 1 (`event_id_dyn`) | Emit `pto.sync.set` from one core type | `pipe`, static `event_id`, optional `ffts_mode`, optional `core_type` |
| `system.sync_wait` | 0 or 1 (`event_id_dyn`) | Emit `pto.sync.wait` on the peer core type | `pipe`, static `event_id`, optional `core_type` |
| `system.set_ffts` | 1 (`workspace`) | Declare the A3 FFTS setup required by explicit cross-core events | — |

Use `pl.system.sync_set(event_id, pipe=..., ffts_mode=...)` and `pl.system.sync_wait(event_id, pipe=...)` in explicitly typed AIC/AIV kernels. In a mixed InCore kernel, pass `core_type=pl.KernelType.AIV` or `core_type=pl.KernelType.AIC` to retain each event operation on the intended lane when the kernel is expanded (the IR attr keeps the lowered `"aiv"` / `"aic"` spelling, which is an output of the API, not an accepted input). `pl.KernelType.MIX` is rejected here — an event pins one lane, and both-lane placement is spelled by omitting `core_type`. Both `system.syncall` and the event ops feed the same `KernelType` classification in `ClassifyCallAffinity`; only their IR attr vocabularies differ (`"aic_only"` vs `"aic"`). On A3, call `pl.system.set_ffts(workspace)` in every participating AIC/AIV function before its first explicit event operation; `workspace` must be a one-dimensional `INT64` tensor with at least 256 elements and acts as the PTOAS setup operand. PyPTO's persistent runtime keeps the hardware FFTS control address installed, so generated runtime wrappers do not replace it with this operand. A5 does not require this setup. `event_id` may be an integer in the user-available range 0–13 or a dynamic `pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX]`; IDs 14 and 15 are reserved. `ffts_mode`, when supplied to `sync_set`, must be 0, 1, or 2. The author of a manual cross-core protocol is responsible for pairing event IDs and pipes. PyPTO's normal automatic intra-core dependency insertion remains enabled and uses the separate `set_flag`/`wait_flag` mechanism, so it does not allocate from these explicit cross-core event IDs.

### Data Transfer Operations

| Operation | Args | Description | Kwargs |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `tile.tpush_to_aiv` | 1 (tile) | Push tile from Cube to Vector | `split`, optional `id` |
| `tile.tpush_to_aic` | 1 (tile) | Push tile from Vector to Cube | `split`, optional `id` |
| `tile.tpop_from_aic` | 0 | Pop tile from Cube pipe (→ TileType) | `split`, optional `id` |
| `tile.tpop_from_aiv` | 0 | Pop tile from Vector pipe (→ TileType) | `split`, optional `id` |
| `system.tfree_to_aic` | 1 (tile) | Release slot back to Cube producer | optional `id` |
| `system.tfree_to_aiv` | 1 (tile) | Release slot back to Vector producer | optional `id` |

### Pipe Initialization Operations

| Operation | Args | Description | Kwargs |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `system.aic_initialize_pipe` | 2 | Init cross-core pipe on Cube side (positional: `c2v_consumer_buf`, `v2c_consumer_buf`, i32 SSA) | `dir_mask`, `slot_size`, optional `slot_num`, optional `local_slot_num`, optional `id` |
| `system.aiv_initialize_pipe` | 2 | Init cross-core pipe on Vector side (positional: `c2v_consumer_buf`, `v2c_consumer_buf`, i32 SSA) | `dir_mask`, `slot_size`, optional `slot_num`, optional `local_slot_num`, optional `id` |

- `slot_num` (when set, must be > 0) pins the GM ring-buffer slot count; omit it to let PTOAS pick its default (8 unidirectional, 4 per direction bidirectional).
- `local_slot_num` (a2/a3 only, must be > 0 and `<= slot_num`) pins the local slot count.
- **Sizing the reserved/imported buffer is your responsibility and is architecture-dependent:** on **a3** use `slot_size * local_slot_num`; on **a5** use `slot_size * slot_num`.

### Buffer Management Operations

| Operation | Args | Description | Kwargs |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `system.reserve_buffer` | 0 | Reserve named cross-core buffer (consumer side) | `name`, `size`, `base`* |
| `system.import_peer_buffer` | 0 | Import buffer from peer function (producer side) | `name`, `peer_func` |

\* `base` defaults to `AUTO (-1)` for compiler-assigned address.

### DSL Example (cross-core V2C unidirectional)

`dir_mask=2` enables V2C only, so the C2V buffer operand must be an inactive-direction placeholder (`0`, or `pl.const(0, pl.INT32)`); the active side passes the reserved/imported buffer handle as the first positional operand.

```python
import pypto.language as pl

@pl.program
class CrossCoreExample:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def vector_producer(self, a: pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP16]):
        peer = pl.import_peer_buffer(name="v2c_buf", peer_func="cube_consumer")
        pl.aiv_initialize_pipe(pl.const(0, pl.INT32), peer, dir_mask=2, slot_size=512)

        tile_a: pl.Tile[[16, 16], pl.FP16] = pl.load(a, [0, 0], [16, 16])
        pl.tpush_to_aic(tile_a, split=0)

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def cube_consumer(self, out: pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP32]:
        buf = pl.reserve_buffer(name="v2c_buf", size=4096, base=0x1000)
        pl.aic_initialize_pipe(pl.const(0, pl.INT32), buf, dir_mask=2, slot_size=512)

        received: pl.Tile[[16, 16], pl.FP16] = pl.tpop_from_aiv(split=0)
        pl.tfree_to_aiv(received)
        result: pl.Tensor[[16, 16], pl.FP32] = pl.store(received, [0, 0], out)
        return result
```

## PrefetchOp: Asynchronous GM→L2 Prefetch

A latency-hiding cache hint. `async_prefetch` starts an SDMA-backed pull of a
global-memory region into L2 while unrelated compute proceeds; `wait` blocks
until it lands. The prefetch changes no tensor values — a kernel is numerically
identical with or without it, so only performance differs.

Unlike most PTO intrinsics, `TPREFETCH_ASYNC` carries no implicit wait-event
synchronization, so completion is explicit via an event/session pair.

### Operations

| DSL | Operands | Result | PTOAS op |
| --- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| `pl.prefetch.make_context()` | None | `PrefetchAsyncContextType` | `pto.make_prefetch_async_context` |
| `pl.prefetch.async_prefetch(src, ctx)` | GM Tensor, context | `AsyncEventType` | `pto.tprefetch_async` |
| `pl.prefetch.session(ctx)` | context | `AsyncSessionType` | `pto.get_prefetch_async_session` |
| `pl.prefetch.wait(evt, session)` | event, session | `BOOL` scalar | `pto.comm.wait_async_event` |

The three result types are opaque singleton markers (no shape, no buffer), in
the same family as `CommCtxType`. The SDMA workspace is not a program operand:
the runtime owns it, and codegen injects a hidden pointer into prefetch kernels.

### Constraints

- `src` must be a **flat contiguous logical-1D GM** region: a fully static shape
  whose dimensions are all `1` except the last (`[N]`, `[1, N]`, `[1, 1, N]`).
  This mirrors the PTOAS `TPrefetchAsyncOp::verify()` check, so a shape mistake
  fails at PyPTO IR construction rather than at PTOAS verification.

### Example Usage

```python
@pl.program
class PrefetchExample:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def main(
        self, x: pl.Tensor[[1, 4096], pl.FP32],
        out: pl.Tensor[[1, 128], pl.FP32],
    ) -> pl.Tensor[[1, 128], pl.FP32]:
        ctx = pl.prefetch.make_context()
        evt = pl.prefetch.async_prefetch(x, ctx)     # warms L2, does not block
        session = pl.prefetch.session(ctx)
        # ... unrelated compute overlaps the prefetch ...
        pl.prefetch.wait(evt, session)               # x is now resident in L2
        tile = pl.load(x, [0, 0], [1, 128])
        return pl.store(tile, [0, 0], out)
```

**Core placement**: this family is **AIV-only**. `TPREFETCH_ASYNC` drives its
SDMA `tmpBuf` from a Vec(UB) scratch tile held inside `PrefetchAsyncContext`
(pto-isa static_asserts `ScratchTile::Loc == TileType::Vec`), and UB lives on
the vector core. The ops declare `CoreAffinity::VECTOR`, so in a mixed kernel
`ExpandMixedKernel` keeps them on the vector lane — they are neither placed on
nor duplicated onto the cube lane.

**Runtime ownership and support**: normal one-shot execution reads the generated
artifact's SDMA requirement and automatically constructs an enabled worker. No
workspace appears in the user, orchestration, or runtime tensor signature. For
an explicitly reused L2 worker, opt in when constructing it:

```python
with ChipWorker(
    config=RunConfig(platform="a2a3", device_id=0), enable_sdma=True
):
    compiled(a, out, config=cfg)
```

The current runtime-provisioned execution path is covered only on onboard a2a3.
An enabled worker on simulator, a5, or another runtime without an SDMA provider
fails during runtime initialization. PyPTO does not allocate a fallback
workspace or silently turn a requested prefetch into a no-op. See
`tests/st/runtime/ops/test_prefetch_async.py` for the a2a3 system test.

**Benefits**:

- **Modularity**: Self-contained operator categories
- **Build Performance**: Changes to one category don't rebuild others
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify operators
- **Scalability**: Straightforward to add new operators

## Adding New Operations

1. **Choose category file**: `src/ir/op/tensor_ops/elementwise.cpp`, `matmul.cpp`, `reduction.cpp`, or `src/ir/op/tile_ops/memory.cpp`, `unary.cpp`

2. **Implement type deduction**:

   ```cpp
   TypePtr DeduceType(const std::vector<ExprPtr>& args,
                      const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::any>>& kwargs) {
     CHECK(args.size() == 2) << "op requires 2 arguments";
     // Validate types, read kwargs, compute output type
     return result_type;
   }
   ```

3. **Register**:

   ```cpp
   REGISTER_OP("tensor.matmul")
       .set_op_category("TensorOp")
       .add_argument("lhs", "Left tensor")
       .add_argument("rhs", "Right tensor")
       .set_attr<DataType>("out_dtype")
       .f_deduce_type(DeduceType);
   ```

4. **Python wrapper** (`python/pypto/ir/op/tensor_ops.py`):

   ```python
   def matmul(lhs: Expr, rhs: Expr, out_dtype=None, a_trans=False) -> Call:
       kwargs = {}
       if out_dtype: kwargs["out_dtype"] = out_dtype.code() if isinstance(out_dtype, DataType) else out_dtype
       if a_trans: kwargs["a_trans"] = a_trans
       return _ir_core.create_op_call("tensor.matmul", [lhs, rhs], kwargs, Span.unknown())
   ```

5. **Add tests** in `tests/ut/ir/` and update `CMakeLists.txt` if needed

**Producing more than one value?** Read [Multi-Output Operators](09-multi_output_ops.md) first — the results belong in a `TupleType`, never in the argument list, and the registry rejects at import any argument such an operator writes that was not declared a workspace.

## References

Core definitions live in `include/pypto/core/common.h` and `include/pypto/ir/`; registry and type-inference implementations are in `src/ir/`, with operator implementations grouped under `src/ir/op/{tensor_ops,tile_ops,sync_ops}/`.
