# PTO Project Ecosystem

## Overview

The PTO (Parallel Tensor/Tile Operation) project is a multi-repo toolchain for programming AI accelerators. It spans the full stack from Python-level tensor programs down to hardware instruction execution.

This document describes **what each repo does**, **how they connect**, and **where the boundaries lie**.

**Two codegen paths from pypto:**

- **InCore functions** (tile-level compute) → `.pto` → PTOAS → pto-isa → AICore binaries
- **Orchestration functions** (task scheduling) → C++ using simpler runtime API → compiled for AICPU

## Component Details

### pypto — Compiler Framework

The core compiler. Takes Python tensor programs and compiles them into device-executable code.

**Inputs:** Python programs written with `pypto.language` DSL (`@pl.program`, `@pl.function`)

**Outputs:**

- `.pto` files — PTO-ISA MLIR dialect, one per InCore kernel function (runs on AICore)
- Orchestration C++ — task scheduling code using simpler runtime API (runs on AICPU)

**Internal pipeline:**

```text
Python DSL → IR (immutable tree) → Pass Pipeline (20+ passes) → CodeGen
```

- **IR layer**: Multi-level representation — Tensor ops, Tile ops, and system ops coexist in the same IR
- **Pass pipeline**: Progressively lowers tensor-level IR to tile-level IR (unrolling, SSA conversion, tiling, memory allocation, etc.)
- **CodeGen**: Two backends — PTO codegen (InCore → `.pto` MLIR for AICore) and Orchestration codegen (→ C++ for AICPU)

**Key directories:**

| Path | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| `include/pypto/ir/` | C++ IR node definitions |
| `src/ir/transforms/` | Compiler passes |
| `src/codegen/` | PTO and Orchestration code generators |
| `python/pypto/language/` | Python DSL frontend |
| `python/pypto/ir/` | Pass manager, compile API |

### pypto-lib — Model Zoo & Primitives

A library of real-world models and primitive tensor functions built **on top of** pypto. Serves as:

1. **Model zoo** — end-to-end model examples (e.g., DeepSeek, FFN, LLaMA) that exercise the full compilation pipeline
2. **Primitive tensor functions** — reusable tensor-level building blocks (elementwise, reduction, matmul) that the compiler tiles and lowers to PTO-ISA

**Depends on:** pypto (imports `pypto.language`, compiles via `pypto.ir.compile`)

**Interface with pypto:** pypto-lib programs are standard pypto programs — they use the same `@pl.program`/`@pl.function` DSL and compile through the same pipeline. No special API exists between them; pypto-lib is a consumer of the pypto framework.

### PTOAS — PTO Assembler & Optimizer

An MLIR-based assembler that consumes `.pto` files produced by pypto's codegen and produces optimized C++ kernel code.

**Inputs:** `.pto` files (PTO-ISA MLIR dialect)

**Outputs:** C++ source files that `#include` pto-isa headers

**Responsibilities:**

- Parse PTO-ISA MLIR dialect
- Apply PTO-level optimization passes (sync insertion, memory planning)
- Lower PTO MLIR to C++ code that calls pto-isa tile instructions

**Interface with pypto:** The `.pto` file is the contract. pypto's PTO codegen emits MLIR using the PTO dialect (ops like `pto.tload`, `pto.tmul`, `pto.alloc_tile`, etc.), and PTOAS parses that dialect. The two repos must agree on the PTO MLIR dialect definition.

### pto-isa — Instruction Set Architecture

Defines the tile-level instruction set for the target hardware. Provides C++ headers that declare the hardware tile instructions (load, store, compute, sync, etc.).

**Consumed by:**

- **PTOAS** — the C++ code PTOAS generates calls pto-isa instructions
- **simpler** — clones pto-isa headers at first build for runtime compilation

**Interface:** C++ header library defining the instruction API. Downstream consumers `#include` pto-isa headers; the hardware vendor provides the target-specific implementations that back these headers.

`runtime/pto_isa.pin` is the single source of truth for the revision, and
simpler owns the only resolver (`simpler_setup.pto_isa.ensure_pto_isa_root`):
it manages one checkout under the runtime's `build/pto-isa`, reuses it only when
that tree is clean and already at the pin, re-clones it otherwise, and verifies
`HEAD` before returning. PyPTO delegates to it rather than resolving the pin
itself — a second resolver could hand the kernel compiler an off-pin tree, and
the compiler skips its own revision re-check precisely because the resolver
already guaranteed the pin. To change the revision, update the runtime-side pin.

`PTO_ISA_ROOT` is *exported* with the resolved path so downstream consumers that
build extern CCE kernels can find the ISA headers, but it is never *read*: an
ambient value is not the pin. Code that needs the headers should call
`pypto.runtime.pto_isa_include_dir()` instead of reading the variable.

### simpler — Task Runtime

Executes compiled programs on Ascend hardware. Manages the three-program execution model: Host, AICPU kernel, and AICore kernel.

**Inputs:**

- Compiled AICore kernel binaries (InCore path: pypto → PTOAS → pto-isa → device compiler)
- Compiled AICPU orchestration binary (Orchestration path: pypto → C++ with simpler runtime API → device compiler)

**Responsibilities:**

- Build and execute task dependency graphs
- Coordinate Host ↔ AICPU ↔ AICore execution
- Handle device memory, synchronization, and handshake protocols

**Interface with pypto:** The orchestration C++ code that pypto generates uses the simpler runtime API (`rt_submit_task`, `make_tensor_external`, etc.), which simpler implements. The runtime API is the contract between pypto's orchestration codegen and simpler.

#### The runtime pin

`runtime/` *is* the simpler submodule, so PyPTO's pin on it is the gitlink —
`git rev-parse HEAD:runtime`. There is no second pin file to drift, for the same reason
`toolchain/versions.env` declines to restate the pto-isa revision.

The installed side carries no version that tracks it: simpler's `pyproject.toml` says
`0.1.0` and always will. Its only revision identity is `_task_interface.__build_commit__`,
stamped by `runtime/python/bindings/CMakeLists.txt` at build time from `git rev-parse HEAD`.

`pypto.runtime.runtime_pin.check_runtime_pin()` compares the two. It runs at import of the
two PyPTO modules that import simpler at module scope — `pypto.runtime.task_interface` and
`pypto.runtime.kernel_compiler` — and a mismatch raises `RuntimePinMismatch` (an
`ImportError`) naming both revisions and the reinstall command.

Simpler carries its own equivalent guard
(`simpler.task_interface._assert_bindings_match_source_tree`), but that one compares the
extension against *its own* source tree and returns early when there is no `.git` beside
it. A wheel, or a `pip install ./runtime` that copies into `site-packages`, is therefore
never checked — and that install is where staleness is hardest to see, because a changed
struct layout makes fields read as 0 with no error.

Two comparisons, two severities:

| Comparison | Meaning | Result |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| `__build_commit__` vs `git -C runtime rev-parse HEAD` | the installed simpler was not built from this tree | error |
| `git -C runtime rev-parse HEAD` vs `git rev-parse HEAD:runtime` | your runtime checkout is off PyPTO's pin | warning (`RuntimePinWarning`) |

The second is only a warning: working on a runtime branch is legitimate.

Everything else is a **skip**, never a failure — a wheel-installed PyPTO with no
`runtime/`, an uninitialized `runtime/` submodule (empty, so it has no revision of its
own), no git available, or a simpler built without git (empty stamp). Refusing to
run because the question is unanswerable would break every legitimate install. An
importable `_task_interface` with *no* `__build_commit__` attribute is not a skip: the
attribute only disappears on an extension compiled before the stamp existed, which is by
definition a different revision.

Check it by hand with `pypto-runtime-pin`, which prints both sides and exits non-zero on a
mismatch; `pypto-runtime-pin --fix` reinstalls `runtime/` and re-verifies in a fresh
interpreter. `PYPTO_SKIP_RUNTIME_PIN_CHECK=1` bypasses the check. The unit suite sets it in
`tests/ut/conftest.py` because it stubs simpler and must not be gated on the installed
revision; system tests run real kernels and are deliberately not exempted.

## Interface Summary

Each repo boundary has a well-defined interface:

```text
pypto-lib ──[ Python API: pypto.language / pypto.ir ]──► pypto
     pypto ──[ .pto files: PTO-ISA MLIR dialect     ]──► PTOAS
   pto-isa ──[ C++ #include: tile instruction hdrs  ]──► PTOAS
   pto-isa ──[ C++ #include: ISA headers            ]──► simpler
     pypto ──[ C++ API: simpler runtime API calls      ]──► simpler
```

| Border | Format | Who provides | Who consumes |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| pypto-lib → pypto | Python imports | pypto-lib | pypto compiler |
| pypto → PTOAS | `.pto` MLIR files | pypto PTO codegen | PTOAS parser |
| pto-isa → PTOAS | C++ `#include` | pto-isa headers | PTOAS codegen |

## Cross-Repo Development

When a change spans multiple repos, identify which interfaces are affected:

| Change | Repos involved | Interface affected |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| New tile instruction | pto-isa + PTOAS + pypto | ISA headers, PTO MLIR dialect, pypto op/codegen |
| New tensor primitive | pypto-lib + pypto | Python DSL (if new ops needed) |
| New runtime feature | simpler + pypto | simpler runtime API, orchestration codegen |
| New PTO MLIR op | PTOAS + pypto | PTO MLIR dialect, pypto PTO codegen |
| New model example | pypto-lib only | None (consumer of existing APIs) |
