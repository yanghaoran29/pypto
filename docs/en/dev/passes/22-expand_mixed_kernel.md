# ExpandMixedKernel Pass

Expands mixed InCore functions into separate AIC (Cube) + AIV (Vector) kernels wrapped in a Group function. Non-mixed InCore functions get their FunctionType converted to AIC or AIV.

## Overview

After `OutlineIncoreScopes` and `ConvertTensorToTileOps`, InCore functions may contain both Cube ops (`tile.matmul`, `tile.gemv`, etc.) and Vector ops (`tile.add`, `tile.exp`, etc.). Some ops like `tile.load`, `tile.store`, `tile.move`, and `tile.reshape` are classified as Cube or Vector based on the MemorySpace of their tile operands. Functions containing ops from both sides are **mixed InCore functions**. Hardware requires Cube and Vector operations to run on separate core types, so this pass splits them into:

- **AIC function** (`FunctionType::AIC`) — contains only Cube + shared ops
- **AIV function** (`FunctionType::AIV`) — contains only Vector + shared ops
- **Group function** (`FunctionType::Group`) — calls AIC then AIV, replaces the original

When an existing Group function already calls the InCore function (e.g. from `OutlineClusterScopes`), the pass **rewrites that Group in-place** to call AIC + AIV directly, avoiding a redundant Group wrapper. When a standalone `Spmd` wrapper calls the InCore function, the pass preserves the `Spmd` wrapper and creates a `Group` callee under it so launch semantics stay on `FunctionType::Spmd`.

For **non-mixed InCore functions** (pure Cube or pure Vector), the pass converts `FunctionType::InCore` to the corresponding type without splitting:

- Pure Cube → `FunctionType::AIC`
- Pure Vector or shared-only → `FunctionType::AIV`

After this pass, no `FunctionType::InCore` functions remain in the program.

### Shared argument ABI for hand-written Groups

One runtime `MixedKernels` submission creates a co-scheduled AIC/AIV task whose
active lanes share one `CoreTaskArgs` payload. Consequently, the two compiled
kernel wrappers must unpack the same tensors-first argument layout. This is
automatic for Groups created by the mixed-kernel splitter, because both member
calls forward the complete Group signature.

A hand-written `pl.cluster()` may instead submit members with different source
signatures, for example `cube(q, k, v, sink, task)` and `vec(out, task)`. The
outlined Group captures the union of those values. This pass normalizes both DSL
members to that Group signature and rewrites both inner `Call` or `Submit` nodes
to forward the complete list. Unused parameters remain valid wrapper arguments;
each cloned body still references only the values from its original call.

When both member kernels are exclusive to the Group, their names are preserved.
If either kernel has another call site, the pass creates a Group-private adapter
pair and rewrites `import_peer_buffer(peer_func=...)` to the adapter peer names,
leaving the original ABI available to the other callers. External-source and
runtime-bound members cannot be body-cloned; when their layouts differ, the pass
rejects the Group and requires both declarations to use the same signature.

This normalization happens before `InjectGMPipeBuffer`, so a backend-injected
`__gm_pipe_buffer` parameter is appended to the already-identical member
signatures. It does not require `sync_start`: AIC and AIV are subslots of one
mixed task, while `sync_start` controls multi-block SPMD launch admission.

## Unsplittable transpose: reject with an actionable error

A requested vector split is **rejected with a `ValueError`** when the kernel
contains a `tile.transpose` that **swaps the split axis**. `tile.transpose` swaps
two axes, so the per-lane split data migrates to the *other* dimension while
`SplitVectorKernel` still halves the *original* split axis — it cannot type such a
transpose correctly, so the result would be mis-shaped and miscompute. This is
independent of split mode (UP_DOWN dim 0 / LEFT_RIGHT dim 1) and dtype.

The split is a performance decision the user owns, so the pass does not silently
drop it (which would compile a slower kernel than asked for). It fails loud and
points at the offending transpose with two fix directions:

1. **Drop the split** — set `attrs={"split": pl.SplitMode.NONE}` (or remove the
   `pl.split(...)` optimization). This is the same un-split kernel the user can
   already request directly.
2. **Eliminate the transpose** — e.g. replace a transpose-then-row-index with a
   direct column slice such as `pre[:, h:h+1]`. This keeps the split, so the
   kernel still gets the requested speedup, and also avoids the pto-isa FP
   transpose tail-path miscompute on device.

`split_axis::FindTransposeSplitHazard` detects this at the start of
`ExpandMixedFunction`: it flags the first `tile.transpose` whose source is
**non-singleton on the split axis** (a source that is singleton on the split axis
carries no split data — the no-op broadcast case — and is left split; a dynamic,
non-`ConstInt` extent is treated as non-singleton and flagged conservatively).

This whole-function check reads a **single** `func->GetSplitMode()`, so it cannot
represent a multi-mode function. By the time `ExpandMixedKernel` runs, any
first-class `SplitAivScopeStmt` regions have already been consumed and erased by
[`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md) (pass 20), which validates
**each region's** transpose hazard with that region's own split axis and stamps
`split_aiv_region_validated` on the function. So this pass skips the single-func-mode
transpose check for functions carrying `split_aiv_region_validated` (the AUTO
whole-function path is unchanged); the scope node never reaches here — only the
per-op `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` markers remain.

Cross-core data transfer at CV boundaries is handled by splitting explicit `tile.move` ops into `tpush`/`tpop` pairs:

| Direction | AIC side | AIV side |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cube→Vector (e.g. Acc→Vec) | `tpush_to_aiv(source_tile)` | `dest_var = tpop_from_aic()` |
| Vector→Cube (e.g. Vec→Mat/Left/Right) | `dest_var = tpop_from_aiv()` | `tile.move` to adapt fractal layout, then `tpush_to_aic(adapted_tile)` |

**Fractal TileView layout**: Cross-core transfer tile views are computed by `BuildCrossCoreTransferView` based on the destination memory space. The mapping differs between backends:

Ascend950 (a5) — hardware cross-core pipe carries data in fractal layout:

| Direction | Push/Pop TileView (blayout, slayout) | Name |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Vec→Left | col_major, row_major | NZ |
| Vec→Right | col_major, row_major | NZ |
| Vec→Mat | must be explicitly set in move | — |
| Mat/Acc→Vec | must be explicitly set in move | — |

`Vec→Right` crosses as NZ, not as the ZN a Right operand ends up in: a5 inserts
the Vec tile into the Mat FIFO through `TINSERT_IMPL<TInsertMode::NZ>`, so the
bridge tile has to stay NZ. The ZN view belongs to the `Mat → Right` `tile.move`
the cube side makes after the pop, which is one step later than this table
describes — the same split the a2a3 table below spells out.

Ascend910B (a2a3) — cross-core transfer goes through GM → Mat, and Mat only supports the NZ layout. Both Left and Right destinations use NZ at the transfer boundary; the final Left/Right layout is resolved by the subsequent `Mat → Left/Right` `tile.move` (MTE1):

| Direction | Push/Pop TileView (blayout, slayout) | Name |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Vec→Left | col_major, row_major | NZ |
| Vec→Right | col_major, row_major | NZ |
| Vec→Mat | preserve original | — |
| Mat/Acc→Vec | preserve original | — |

On both backends, the AIV push side (V→C) inserts a `tile.move` before `tpush_to_aic` to convert the source tile into the required fractal layout. The `tile.move` helper (`CreateMove`) propagates `blayout`/`slayout` kwargs when the result type carries a TileView.

### Hand-written pipes get the same adapter

The rule above describes the boundary-move path, which only sees the pipes this pass
builds while expanding an InCore function. A pipe authored directly (`pl.reserve_buffer`,
`pl.{aic,aiv}_initialize_pipe` and `pl.tpush_to_aic`, written out by hand) never reaches
it. On a backend where `RequiresVtoCFractalAdapt()` holds, such a push would ship a bare
ND tile into a FIFO the cube reads as fractal, scattering every element of the popped
tile.

`AdaptManualVtoCPush` closes that gap. It runs as the pass's final phase, over **every**
AIV function the pass emits — not over the functions it was handed. That distinction
matters: `tile.tpush_to_aic` declares `CoreAffinity::VECTOR`, so a hand-written push is
legal inside an InCore body, and such a body only becomes an AIV function during this
pass. A pure-vector body reaches AIV through the non-mixed conversion, and a mixed body
carries the statement into its expanded AIV half; both happen after the per-function loop,
so an earlier hook would still leave the bare ND push behind.

Three properties keep the sweep cheap and safe:

- **One fixed boundary, no cross-function analysis.** The adapter asks for the cube-side
  transfer memory, `GetBoundaryTpopMemory(CoreSide::AIC)`, instead of locating the
  matching `tpop` in the peer function. That is exact rather than approximate because
  `BuildCrossCoreTransferView` maps `Mat`, `Left` and `Right` onto the same fractal view:
  wherever the consumer pops to, the layout it expects is the one this produces.
- **Idempotent, and it defers to the author.** A push whose source already carries the
  boundary view is left alone. Re-running the pass adds nothing, a program that stages
  the move by hand keeps its own, and the pushes the boundary-move path already adapted
  are not touched twice.
- **The backend is consulted lazily.** `RequiresVtoCFractalAdapt()` is read inside the
  mutator, on the first V→C push it meets, so a program with no hand-written push does
  not need a configured backend to walk past this phase.

The rewritten push preserves the original call's kwargs — dropping `id` would collapse a
multi-pipe program onto a single FIFO.

### GM-mediated cross-lane dependencies

A `tile.move` is not the only way data crosses the CV boundary. When one lane writes a GM tensor with `tile.store` and the other lane reads the same tensor with `tile.load`, the data crosses *through GM*. Because neither op is a `tile.move`, CV-boundary detection misses the dependency, and without a fence the two split kernels race on the shared GM region (issue #1433).

`CollectGmCrossLaneSyncs` detects these store/load pairs and emits a **pure-synchronisation** handshake: the data still flows through GM unchanged, while a `tpush` (producer, right after the store) and a matching `tpop` (consumer, right before the load) establish the missing happens-before edge. The popped tile is a fence token, freed immediately by `FinalizeTpopTfrees`; `BuildAutomaticPipeSetup` then injects the same pipe setup as for `tile.move` boundaries.

| Producer (writes GM) | AIC side | AIV side |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cube store → Vector load | `tile.store ...; tpush_to_aiv(stored_tile)` | `tok = tpop_from_aic(); tfree_to_aic(tok); tile.load ...` |

To stay deadlock-free, a handshake is emitted only when (1) the GM origin tensor has exactly one producer-lane store, (2) the opposite-lane load lives in the **same structural body** (same loop/branch, so the `tpush`/`tpop` execute the same number of times), and (3) the store precedes the load. Pairs split across different loops or branches are left untouched.

Only the **Cube→Vector** direction (cube `tile.store` → vector `tile.load`) is fenced. The AIC `tpush` sends the stored tile raw, exactly as the normal boundary C2V push does on both backends, and the AIV `tpop` lands in `Vec`. The reverse Vector→Cube direction would require the V→C fractal-layout adaptation that the `tile.move` boundary path applies before `tpush_to_aic`; emitting a raw-tile sync there would violate the cross-core transport contract, so V2C GM exchanges are left unfenced.

When split kernels contain cross-core `tpush`/`tpop`, the pass also prepends the required frontend pipe setup automatically:

- `system.reserve_buffer(...)` on the consumer side
- `system.import_peer_buffer(...)` on the producer side
- `system.aic_initialize_pipe(...)` / `system.aiv_initialize_pipe(...)` on both sides

In addition, the pass inserts `system.tfree_to_aic(...)` / `system.tfree_to_aiv(...)`
after every consumer-side `tpop` chain.

Setup is derived from the split bodies:

- `dir_mask`: `C2V=1`, `V2C=2`, bidirectional=`3`
- `id`: omitted for automatic setup, so PTOAS uses the default frontend pipe id `0`
- `slot_size`: max tile byte size across all directions (`shape * dtype bits / 8`)
- `slot_num`: ring depth — `2` by default, in every direction; always emitted explicitly; overridable per scope (see below)
- `buffer_size`: `slot_num * slot_size`
- buffer names: `<func>_c2v_slot_buffer` / `<func>_v2c_slot_buffer`
- reserve-buffer base: `AUTO` on insertion, then resolved to an explicit address by `AllocateMemoryAddr`

When cross-core directions use different tile sizes, the pass picks `max(all observed tile byte sizes)` as the common `slot_size` for `initialize_pipe`. Smaller tiles leave unused bytes in each slot but hardware correctness is preserved. Explicit user-authored programs can still create multiple independent pipes by supplying different `id` values to `initialize_pipe` and matching `tpush` / `tpop` / `tfree` ops.

### Known limitation: MX quantization followed by matmul

The automatic setup does not yet support carrying both `quant_mx` data and its
FP8E8M0 scale to `matmul_mx` inside one mixed task. Keep the operations in
separate AIV and AIC kernels and stage both values through GM. Automatic paired
data/scale pipes are deferred to a follow-up change.

### Overriding the slot count (`slot_num`)

The default slot count (`cross_core_pipe::kDefaultAutoPipeSlotNum` = 2) can be
tuned per scope with the `pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)` optimization entry:

```python
# Deepen the auto-inserted ring so the cube can run further ahead of the vector
# core, at the cost of consumer-side buffer space.
with pl.spmd(4, optimizations=[pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=4)]):
    ...

# Or on the pl.at form, alongside an independent split mode:
with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP,
           optimizations=[pl.split(pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN),
                          pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=16)]):
    ...
```

The value is carried as the `slot_num` scope attr, propagated by
`OutlineIncoreScopes` to the outlined function's `slot_num` attr, and read here.
It drives **both** the reserved buffer (`slot_size * slot_num`) and the emitted
`initialize_pipe` `slot_num` attribute, so PTOAS and the auto-reserved buffer
stay consistent. Automatic setup **always** emits the attribute, whether or not
the scope overrides it: PTOAS derives its own depth from `dir_mask` (8
unidirectional, 4 bidirectional) when the clause is absent, which would index
past a buffer reserved for a shallower ring. Only hand-written
`pl.system.{aic,aiv}_initialize_pipe` still reaches that fallback.
`slot_num` must be positive and is **orthogonal to splitting** — it sizes a data
channel, it does not partition work. It applies in whichever directions the
scope actually uses (cube->vector, vector->cube, or both), and to any scope that
drives a pipe: a kernel with no split at all still drives one (on a2a3 via
dual-AIV dispatch — see below). It is ignored only when the outlined scope ends
up with no cross-core ops.

**Deprecated:** `pl.split(MODE, slot_num=N)` still accepts the slot count and
emits a `DeprecationWarning`. That spelling forced authors to name a split mode
they did not want — the `pl.split(pl.SplitMode.NONE, slot_num=N)` idiom — which
`OutlineIncoreScopes` now rejects on any scope carrying `pl.split_aiv` regions.
Move the value to `pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)`; the printer already
normalises to that form.

> Decoupling the logical ring depth from a smaller local resident window
> (`local_slot_num < slot_num`, an a2/a3-only optimisation) is not yet exposed
> on the automatic split path — use the manual `pl.aic_initialize_pipe` /
> `pl.aiv_initialize_pipe` system ops for that.
>
> That manual route is a2/a3-only too, and not just for `local_slot_num <
> slot_num`: ptoas rejects the `local_slot_num` operand on
> `pto.{aic,aiv}_initialize_pipe` for the 950 frontend pipe lowering whatever
> its value, so on a5 the operand must be omitted entirely.

For consumer-side cross-core tiles, the pass also ensures each `tile.tpop_*` has a matching
`system.tfree_*`. When an existing free is obviously too early, the pass delays it to a later statement in the same
block without reordering independent `tpop` chains. When AIC must post-process a `tile.tpop_from_aiv` result with a
same-side `tile.move` (for example Mat -> Left/Right/Bias), the generated `system.tfree_to_aiv(...)` is rewritten to
free the canonical popped tile value and can be delayed past that carrier chain.

For Ascend910B (a2a3), mixed kernels with **no function split mode** (`split` unset or `SplitMode.None`) are also
supported. In that case the pass keeps a single AIV kernel body, marks it for **dual AIV dispatch**, and later lowering
emits a runtime `subblock_idx` branch: AIV lane 0 executes the original body, while AIV lane 1 replays the cross-core
handshakes with tile-producing replay work forced to `valid_shape=[0, 0]`, and visible `tile.store` writes suppressed.
This keeps the AIC/AIV handshakes balanced for `pl.at(level=CORE_GROUP)` no-split mixed
kernels while the secondary sync lane avoids real DMA/compute work.

This replay path applies only to **non-`split_aiv`** mixed kernels. A function carrying a `pl.split_aiv` region — any
mode, including the task-parallel `pl.SplitMode.NONE` — is stamped `split_aiv` by
[`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md) (pass 20), so [`SplitVectorKernel`](24-split_vector_kernel.md)
routes it through the split path (both AIV lanes dispatch via `dual_aiv_dispatch`) and never the lane-0-only replay
above. For a `NONE` region this is exactly right: both lanes run the **full** body for disjoint, `aiv_id`-dispatched
work — dropping lane-1 stores would be a miscompile.

**Requirements**:

- Input IR must have tile ops (run `ConvertTensorToTileOps` first)
- Input IR must have InCore scopes outlined (run `OutlineIncoreScopes` first)
- Tile ops must be flattened to 2D (run `FlattenTileNdTo2D` first)
- Tile memory space must be inferred (run `InferTileMemorySpace` first)
- Cross-core fractal TileView assignment is supported on Ascend950 and Ascend910B backends

**When to use**: Run after `InferTileMemorySpace` when InCore functions may contain both Cube and Vector tile operations.

> **Note**: This pass is part of the default tile optimization pipeline. You can also invoke it explicitly via
> `passes.expand_mixed_kernel()(program)` when debugging or building a custom pass pipeline.

## Algorithm

```text
Phase 1 — Pre-scan:
  Identify InCore functions that have existing Group callers and
  callers that still need the original function name to remain callable.

Phase 2 — Expand each InCore function F:
  1. Recursively classify affinity of all statements (including inside loops/conditionals)
  2. Detect CV boundary moves: tile.move ops crossing cube↔vector memory spaces
     (recorded in a separate boundary_moves map, not as a distinct affinity)
  2a. Detect GM-mediated cross-lane store/load pairs (CollectGmCrossLaneSyncs):
      a tile.store on one lane + a tile.load on the other from the same GM
      tensor origin, scheduled as a tpush/tpop sync fence (see "GM-mediated
      cross-lane dependencies" above)
  3. If not mixed (no CUBE ops or no VECTOR ops, and no boundary moves):
     convert FunctionType to AIC (pure Cube) or AIV (pure Vector / shared-only)
  4. Build AIC body: keep CUBE + SHARED stmts, prune VECTOR, recurse into MIXED loops
     - For boundary move (Cube→Vector): emit tpush_to_aiv(source_tile)
     - For boundary move (Vector→Cube): emit dest_var = tpop_from_aiv() with fractal TileView
  4a. For an op-driven boundary (tile.aiv_shard / tile.aic_gather), derive the
      pto-isa split CODE for the tpush/tpop pair from the op's authored MODE plus
      the full-width tile's extents (BoundaryTransportSplitCode ->
      split_axis::ShardSplitCode / GatherSplitCode) — see "The split code" below
  5. Build AIV body: symmetric (keep VECTOR + SHARED, prune CUBE)
     - For boundary move (Cube→Vector): emit dest_var = tpop_from_aic() with fractal TileView
     - For boundary move (Vector→Cube): emit tile.move to adapt fractal layout, then tpush_to_aic(adapted_tile)
  5a. Assign fractal TileView to all boundary tpop result types and pre-tpush tile.move ops
      via BuildCrossCoreTransferView:
      - Ascend950: Left→NZ, Right→ZN, Mat/Vec→preserve
      - Ascend910B: Left→NZ, Right→NZ (Mat only supports NZ), Mat/Vec→preserve
  6. Repair loop-carried state on both bodies
     - Strip dead iter_args whose carried values are unused on this side
     - Pull back missing init-value definitions for surviving iter_args
     - Rewrite dangling yields to identity yields when a branch-local value was stripped
     - Remap dangling tile.store result vars (SSA versions stripped by AIC-side splitting) to the corresponding output parameter
  7. Run dead code elimination on both bodies (recursive into loops)
  8. Normalize loop-carried state again, because DCE may remove a SHARED-only
     post-loop use that temporarily kept an iter_arg alive
  9. Run dead code elimination again to clean up init-value chains exposed
     by the second strip
 10. Ensure each consumer-side `tpop` chain has a matching
     `system.tfree_to_aic` / `system.tfree_to_aiv`, delaying obviously early frees within the same block when needed
 11. If the split bodies use cross-core tile ops and do not already contain setup,
      derive reserve/import/initialize_pipe prologues and prepend them
 12. Create AIC function (no return) and AIV function (original return)
     - On Ascend910B no-split mixed kernels, tag the generated AIV with dual-dispatch metadata
       so later lowering launches the same AIV kernel on both vector lanes and rewrites the secondary lane's tile
       replay path to `valid_shape=[0, 0]`
 13. If a non-Group caller still needs the original function name
     (for example a standalone Spmd wrapper): also create a Group
     function (calls AIC then AIV)
 14. If there are only existing Group callers: skip the extra Group wrapper

Phase 3 — Rewrite Group callers:
  For each Group function that calls a split InCore, replace the InCore call
  with an AIC call + AIV call sequence (EvalStmt for AIC, AssignStmt for AIV).

Phase 4 — Normalize hand-written mixed Group ABIs:
  For each Group whose AIC/AIV calls do not both forward the complete Group
  signature, rebuild the DSL member bodies against one canonical parameter list
  and rewrite both Call/Submit nodes to pass it. Preserve exclusive member names;
  otherwise create Group-private adapters and retarget peer_func references.
```

**Affinity classification**:

| Affinity | Ops | Classification Rule |
| -------- | --- | ------------------- |
| CUBE | `tile.matmul`, `tile.matmul_acc`, `tile.matmul_bias`, `tile.gemv`, `tile.gemv_acc`, `tile.gemv_bias`, `tile.batch_matmul`, `tile.batch_matmul_acc` | Always CUBE (op name) |
| CUBE or VECTOR | `tile.load` | By `target_memory` kwarg: cube memory (Mat, Left, Right, Acc, Bias) → CUBE; Vec → VECTOR |
| CUBE or VECTOR | `tile.store`, `tile.reshape` | By source tile's `memory_space`: cube memory → CUBE; Vec → VECTOR |
| MIXED | `tile.move` crossing cube↔vector memory | Leaf cross-side move — also recorded in the `boundary_moves` map (see below) |
| CUBE or VECTOR | `tile.move` (same-side) | By source tile's `memory_space` |
| VECTOR | All other `tile.*` ops (`tile.add`, `tile.exp`, `tile.sub`, etc.) | Always VECTOR (op name) |
| VECTOR | `pld.tile.put`, `pld.tile.get`, `pld.tensor.put`, `pld.tensor.get` | Declared `set_core_affinity(VECTOR)` — TPUT/TGET stream through a VEC staging tile, which ptoas enforces |
| SHARED | Non-tile ops, function calls, control flow, scalar ops | — |
| SHARED | `pld.system.notify`, `pld.system.wait` | Core-agnostic by ISA (pure scalar/GM), so no affinity is declared. `notify` also declares `set_no_duplicate()` (both `NotifyOp` forms) — a cube-lane copy can release the peer before the vector lane's TPUT lands the data; `wait` does not, since it *blocks* and its cube-lane copy is load-bearing |
| MIXED | Compound statements containing both CUBE and VECTOR children | — |
| VECTOR | any call stamped `attrs["core_placement"] = "aiv"` | Region placement — outranks every rule above |

**Region placement outranks inference.** A call stamped
`attrs["core_placement"] = "aiv"` resolves to `VECTOR`, keeping a
`pld.system.notify` off the cube lane. The stamp, its carve-outs and its lifetime
are documented at [`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md); this
pass reads it, then **strips** it. It does not make the op run *once* — see
[Scopes and Placement](../../user/language/04-scopes.md).

**CV boundary detection**: A `tile.move` is a CV boundary when its source tile memory and target memory are on different core sides. Cube-side memory: Mat, Left, Right, Acc, Bias. Vector-side memory: Vec. Same-side moves (e.g. Mat→Left) are classified by their source memory as usual. Boundary leaf moves are tagged `MIXED` for affinity purposes and are also recorded in a separate `boundary_moves` map; the cross-core direction (Cube→Vector vs Vector→Cube) is recovered via `ClassifyMoveDirection` at the call sites that need it (`CollectCVBoundaryMoves`, `BuildCoreBody`).

**Nested structure handling**: ForStmt, IfStmt, and WhileStmt containing mixed ops are duplicated into both AIC and AIV bodies with recursively pruned contents.

**Loop-state repair after splitting**: mixed-loop control flow is intentionally preserved during body construction, which can leave one side with extra iter_args, missing init-value definitions, or yields that reference stripped branch-local values. The pass repairs those cases before DCE, then normalizes loop-carried state once more after DCE because dead shared aliases can disappear and make an iter_arg removable only at that stage. A final DCE pass cleans up any init-value chains that become dead after the second strip.

**Group wrapper param-returns**: a newly created Group wrapper
returns its own parameters when every return position traces to a param
writeback (via `return_lineage::ReturnedParamIndices`) — the AIV call is
emitted as a bare `EvalStmt` and the wrapper returns the matching Group
params directly (e.g. `return out_0`), keeping the `ReturnParamsExplicit`
invariant. Only when some position is not a param writeback does it fall back
to the legacy `result = aiv_call(); return result` form.

## The split code

`tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` carry the authored **mode** (`0` / `1` / `2`);
the transport pair this pass mints carries pto-isa's `TileSplitAxis` **code**
(`0`..`4`), which additionally says how the two AIV lanes' *runtime* extents
relate — that is how the consumer finds lane 1's band inside the FIFO slot:

| Code | pto-isa | Lane 1's band starts at | Requires |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| 1 / 2 | `TILE_UP_DOWN` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT` | `e1 * pitch` | `e0 == e1` |
| 3 / 4 | `TILE_UP_DOWN_ODD` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT_ODD` | `(e1 + 1) * pitch` | `e0 == e1 + 1` |

`BoundaryTransportSplitCode` reads the lane extents `eL = clamp(V - L*S, 0, S)`
off the FULL-width tile — the shard's operand (Cube→Vector) or the gather's result
(Vector→Cube). `S` is the partition stride: the tile's physical half, or the
balanced `lane_stride=S` attr when
[LowerAutoVectorSplit](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md) rebalanced a ragged
boundary. So an odd split axis (an odd physical box, an odd valid extent inside
an even one, or a rebalanced odd valid region) takes the odd code, an empty
lane 1 keeps the even one, and a ragged extent pto-isa cannot place — only
reachable on the box partition — is rejected with the extents that would work.
Both lane bodies run the same derivation on the same inputs, so the AIC and AIV
sides always agree. The Vector→Cube gather has no odd form (pto-isa's vector-side
producer offsets lane 1 by lane 1's own extent), so it is even-only. Full
derivation: [LowerAutoVectorSplit](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md).

## Example 1: InCore without existing Group caller

When Orchestration calls InCore directly, a new Group wrapper is created.

**Before** (after `InferTileMemorySpace`):

```python
@pl.program
class Before:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def compute_incore_0(self, x: pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.BF16],
                         y: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.BF16],
                         out_0: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]]
                         ) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        x_mat: pl.Tile[[16, 128], pl.BF16] = pl.load(x, [0, 0], [16, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
        y_mat: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.BF16] = pl.load(y, [0, 0], [128, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
        x_left: pl.Tile[[16, 128], pl.BF16] = pl.move(x_mat, target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
        y_right: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.BF16] = pl.move(y_mat, target_memory=pl.Mem.Right)
        z_tile: pl.Tile[[16, 128], pl.FP32] = pl.matmul(x_left, y_right)
        z_vec: pl.Tile[[16, 128], pl.FP32] = pl.move(z_tile, target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
        out_0 = pl.store(z_vec, [0, 0], out_0)
        return out_0

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x, y) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        out_0 = pl.create_tensor([16, 128], dtype=pl.FP32)
        return self.compute_incore_0(x, y, out_0)
```

**After** (conceptual — actual IR includes type annotations on all variables; auto-generated pipe setup is omitted here for brevity):

```python
@pl.program
class After:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.AIC)
    def compute_incore_0_aic(self, x, y, out_0):
        x_mat = pl.load(x, [0, 0], [16, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)  # CUBE: load to Mat
        y_mat = pl.load(y, [0, 0], [128, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat) # CUBE: load to Mat
        x_left = pl.move(x_mat, target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)   # CUBE: Mat→Left (same-side)
        y_right = pl.move(y_mat, target_memory=pl.Mem.Right)  # CUBE: Mat→Right (same-side)
        z_tile = pl.matmul(x_left, y_right)              # CUBE op
        pl.tile.tpush_to_aiv(z_tile, split=0)        # boundary move: push Acc tile to AIV

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.AIV)
    def compute_incore_0_aiv(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        # tpop result carries fractal TileView (no layout for Vec destination → preserved)
        z_vec: pl.Tile[[16, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec, pl.TileView()] = pl.tile.tpop_from_aic(split=0)
        out_0 = pl.store(z_vec, [0, 0], out_0)           # VECTOR op
        pl.system.tfree_to_aic(z_vec)                    # release the consumed cross-core slot
        return out_0

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Group)
    def compute_incore_0(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        self.compute_incore_0_aic(x, y, out_0)
        self.compute_incore_0_aiv(x, y, out_0)
        return out_0  # param-return: the AIV result writes through out_0

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x, y) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        out_0 = pl.create_tensor([16, 128], dtype=pl.FP32)
        return self.compute_incore_0(x, y, out_0)  # calls Group (same name)
```

## Example 2: InCore with existing Group caller

When `OutlineClusterScopes` has already created a Group function calling the InCore, the pass rewrites the existing Group instead of creating a new wrapper. When `OutlineClusterScopes` has created a standalone `Spmd` wrapper, the pass keeps that `Spmd` function and retargets it to a new `Group` callee with the original InCore name.

**Before**:

```python
@pl.program
class Before:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def compute_incore_0(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        # ... mixed Cube + Vector ops ...

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Group)
    def compute_group(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        result = self.compute_incore_0(x, y, out_0)
        return result

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x, y) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        out_0 = pl.create_tensor([16, 128], dtype=pl.FP32)
        return self.compute_group(x, y, out_0)
```

**After** — existing Group is rewritten, no `compute_incore_0` Group wrapper:

```python
@pl.program
class After:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.AIC)
    def compute_incore_0_aic(self, x, y, out_0):
        # ... Cube ops + tpush ...

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.AIV)
    def compute_incore_0_aiv(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        # ... tpop + Vector ops ...

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Group)
    def compute_group(self, x, y, out_0) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        self.compute_incore_0_aic(x, y, out_0)       # rewritten: AIC call
        result = self.compute_incore_0_aiv(x, y, out_0)  # rewritten: AIV call
        return result

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x, y) -> pl.Tensor[[16, 128], pl.FP32]:
        out_0 = pl.create_tensor([16, 128], dtype=pl.FP32)
        return self.compute_group(x, y, out_0)  # unchanged
```

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/expand_mixed_kernel_pass.cpp`

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_expand_mixed_kernel.py`

## Pass Properties

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Required | SSAForm, IncoreTileOps, SplitIncoreOrch, TileOps2D, TileMemoryInferred, NormalizedStmtStructure |
| Produced | SSAForm, MixedKernelExpanded, NormalizedStmtStructure, HardSyncallOccupancyValid, AccCompactValid |
| Invalidated | AccCompactValid |

`HardSyncallOccupancyValid` is produced here not by anything this pass rewrites, but because resolving each kernel's `FunctionType` to AIV/AIC/Group is the precondition the hard-syncall occupancy verifier depends on. That verifier fires once, right after this pass.

`AccCompactValid` is invalidated and re-produced because the Cube->Vector boundary `tile.move` is rebuilt here as a tpush/tpop pair with a freshly built consumer type, so the Acc compact contract has to be re-checked on that new IR rather than trusted from `InferTileMemorySpace`.

## Property Verifier

`MixedKernelExpandedPropertyVerifier` checks:

- no remaining `FunctionType::InCore` function contains both Cube and Vector tile ops
- `tile.tpop_from_aiv` in AIC lands in `MemorySpace::Mat`
- `tile.tpop_from_aic` in AIV lands in `MemorySpace::Vec`
- AIC/AIV functions with cross-core `tpush`/`tpop` also contain the required pipe setup
- every AIC/AIV `tile.tpop_*` has a matching `system.tfree_*`
- cross-core tile ops have statically known tile shapes (required for auto pipe setup)

This moves common failures (missing `initialize_pipe`, missing `reserve_buffer` / `import_peer_buffer`, missing `tfree`,
non-static tile sizes, mismatched cross-core `tpop`/`tfree` pairs) from PTO codegen / `ptoas` time to immediately after
`ExpandMixedKernel`. The verifier checks pairing by tile value/op; it does not prove that a `tfree` is placed after the
true last use of that tile.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
| -------- | --------- |
| Move-based CV boundary detection | Explicit `tile.move` ops mark boundaries — no fragile variable data-flow analysis needed |
| `boundary_moves` map (not a separate enum value) | Boundary status is derivable from `ClassifyMoveDirection` at the call sites that need it; storing it as a side map keeps `CoreAffinity` to the four execution-side categories (CUBE / VECTOR / SHARED / MIXED) |
| MemorySpace-based classification for data-movement ops | `tile.load`/`tile.store`/`tile.move`/`tile.reshape` serve Cube or Vector depending on which memory they touch; `InferTileMemorySpace` sets this before the pass runs |
| Fractal TileView on tpop results | tpop result types carry the fractal TileView (NZ/ZN) directly rather than stripping layout — downstream passes and codegen see the correct layout without extra inference |
| Pre-tpush `tile.move` on AIV side | V→C transfers require data in fractal layout; inserting an explicit `tile.move` before `tpush_to_aic` makes the layout conversion visible in IR |
| `CreateMove` propagates layout kwargs | When the result type has a TileView, `blayout`/`slayout` are forwarded as kwargs so the generated `tile.move` call is self-describing |
| Group keeps original function name | When no existing Group caller: Orchestration call sites work unchanged — no call-site rewriting needed |
| Rewrite existing Group callers | When a Group already calls the InCore (e.g. from `OutlineClusterScopes`): rewrite it in-place to call AIC + AIV, avoiding redundant Group→Group nesting |
| Preserve standalone Spmd wrappers | When a standalone `Spmd` calls the InCore: keep `FunctionType::Spmd`, create a `Group` callee underneath, and keep `core_num` / `sync_start` on the Spmd wrapper |
| Parameters copied to all three functions | Simplifies wiring; DCE removes unused params in downstream passes |
| Recursive compound-stmt handling | Correctly splits mixed ops inside `ForStmt`, `IfStmt`, `WhileStmt` |
| Two-stage post-split loop-state repair | First makes loop-carried state valid, then re-strips iter_args after DCE removes dead shared aliases, with a final DCE to clean up exposed init-value chains |
| Auto-generated pipe setup | Tensor-level mixed kernels do not need handwritten `reserve_buffer` / `import_peer_buffer` / `initialize_pipe`; the pass derives them from cross-core tile ops |
| Auto-generated tfree chains | Consumer-side split kernels insert missing `tfree` calls, rewrite them to free the canonical popped tile value, and delay obviously early frees within the same block without reordering independent `tpop` chains |
| Max-slot-size policy | Uses `max(all tile byte sizes)` as the single `initialize_pipe.slot_size`, matching the backend assumption of one automatic reserve/import buffer per direction while preserving legacy bidirectional `dir_mask=3` behavior |
