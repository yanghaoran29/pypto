# LowerAutoVectorSplit Pass

Converts an AUTO `pl.split` mixed `InCore` function into the **explicit
`split_aiv` form** *before* `ExpandMixedKernel`. It inserts `tile.aiv_shard`
at cube→vector boundaries and `tile.aic_gather` at vector→cube boundaries,
halves only the **vector sub-region** along the split axis, injects
`tile.get_subblock_idx()`, and stamps `split` + `split_aiv` on the function.

This is the **live auto-split lowering path**: it always runs, immediately
before `ExpandMixedKernel`. After it runs, every split function reaches
[`SplitVectorKernel`](24-split_vector_kernel.md) already `split_aiv`-marked,
so that pass only stamps attributes (its split_aiv arm) — its former per-op
halving driver was deleted, and the halving machinery now lives solely in
`split_axis_utils`, shared by this pass.

This pass is also the **sole consumer of the first-class `SplitAivScopeStmt`
region node** (`for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(...)`). The region survives parse →
SSA → `ResolveBackendOpLayouts` as a structural node; here each region is
lowered in place and the scope wrapper is **erased**, so no `SplitAivScopeStmt`
reaches `ExpandMixedKernel` (pass 21) or codegen.

## Why this pass exists

A mixed `InCore` function written with `pl.split` describes cube and vector work
in one body, with the split intent expressed only by the function-level `split`
mode. Rather than halve the AIV body op-by-op *after* `ExpandMixedKernel` has
already split it (the old `SplitVectorKernel` path, which duplicated the boundary
semantics `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` already encode), this pass
rewrites the AUTO body into the same explicit `split_aiv` shape a hand-authored
kernel uses, *before* that split. `ExpandMixedKernel`'s single op-driven boundary
arm then folds shard/gather into split-stamped `tpush`/`tpop` for auto and
hand-written kernels alike — one downstream path. The result is byte-identical to
the old halving (proved during the staged convergence): both call the same
`split_axis::ProcessStmts` machinery, and only the entry point differs.

## API

| C++ | Python | Level |
| --- | ------ | ----- |

```python

## Pass Properties

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Required | `SSAForm`, `IncoreTileOps`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `TileOps2D`, `TileMemoryInferred`, `NormalizedStmtStructure`, `AivSplitValid` |
| Produced | `SSAForm`, `IncoreTileOps`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `TileOps2D`, `TileMemoryInferred`, `NormalizedStmtStructure` |
| Invalidated | `AivSplitValid` |

This pass closes the `AivSplitValid` verification window that `OutlineIncoreScopes` opened: it consumes and erases the first-class `SplitAivScopeStmt` regions, so the structural region verifier cannot run after it. Hence `AivSplitValid` is required on entry and invalidated on exit. The rest of the set is unchanged across the pass — the still-mixed InCore body is rewritten in place.

Source: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/pass_properties.h`
(`kLowerAutoVectorSplitProperties`).

## Scope

A function is rewritten iff **all** of:

- `func_type_ == FunctionType::InCore`, and
- it carries a function-level split mode (`UpDown` / `LeftRight`,
  `mode != None`), and
- it is **not already** `split_aiv` (hand-authored explicit kernels are left
  untouched — they already carry the explicit shard/gather form), and
- it is **genuinely mixed** (cube↔vector): its rolled-up affinity is `MIXED`,
  the same `ClassifyCallAffinity` / `CombineAffinity` decision `ExpandMixedKernel`
  uses for `is_mixed`.

Everything else is passed through unchanged. The last condition matters: a
**pure-vector** `pl.split` function (an elementwise op split across the two AIV
lanes, with no cube and no C↔V boundary) has nothing to converge, so it is left
untouched and `ExpandMixedKernel` converts it to a plain AIV function and strips
its `split` attr exactly as before. Were it lowered here, it would carry
`split_aiv` without a `split` mode after that strip, and `SplitVectorKernel` would
reject it.

**A mixed function whose body still carries a `ScopeStmt` is rejected**, on the
same rule as the region path below: whole-function halving does not cross a scope
boundary either. The rolled-up affinity is computed *through* the scope (a scope's
affinity is its body's), so the pass can tell a mixed scope-bodied function from a
pure-vector one and reject only the former — a pure-vector body is still passed
through, not failed. Normally unreachable, since the function-level `split` attr
this path keys on is written by `OutlineIncoreScopes`, which consumes the scope in
the same step; it is checked rather than assumed because the alternative failure
is silent. Before the check, `RollupAffinity` had no `ScopeStmt` arm at all, so any
scope-bodied function rolled up `SHARED`, read as not-mixed, and was passed through
**completely unsplit with no diagnostic**.

## Explicit `SplitAivScopeStmt` region path

In addition to the AUTO whole-function path above, an `InCore` function whose body
still carries one or more `SplitAivScopeStmt` regions takes a separate **region
path** (`LowerExplicitRegionFunction`), checked **before** the AUTO path. Each
region carries its own `split_` mode, so this handles the multi-mode case the
single function-level mode cannot. Region-local `tile_vars` / `var_replacements`
maps keep a halved var from leaking into a sibling region or an out-of-region op;
statements **outside** any region are emitted full-width. After all regions are
lowered, the wrappers are dropped and the function is stamped `split_aiv` +
`split_aiv_region_validated` (the latter signals
[`ExpandMixedKernel`](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) to skip its single-func-mode
transpose check — this pass validates each region's transpose hazard with the
correct per-region split axis instead).

### The out-of-region contract (manual mode)

"Emitted full-width" describes what this pass *does* with an out-of-region
statement, not what an author may *write* there. A function opening **at least
one** region enters **manual mode**: the regions own vector placement, and the
[`AivSplitValid`](99-verifier.md) verifier enforces that division well before
this pass runs:

| op / value | inside a region | outside every region |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| vector compute | AIV | **rejected** — check (e) |
| `tile.load` / `tile.store` | AIV | allowed (compiler-materialised) |
| cube compute | **rejected** — check (a) | AIC |
| `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` | the boundary | **rejected** — check (c) |
| `pld.system.notify` | pinned to AIV | duplicated onto both (**not** diagnosed) |

So outside a region this pass sees only cube work, the `tile.load` /
`tile.store` pairs `ConvertTensorToTileOps` hoists out, and core-agnostic
scalar / control-flow statements — never full-width vector compute, which must be
wrapped in `for _ in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):`. The multi-mode
goal is *regions only, one per vector phase*; a function with **no** region is
untouched. Checks (f)/(g) add that a tile crossing a region edge must name the
crossing, so no implicit cube↔vector crossing reaches this pass.

The last row is **documented, not enforced**, and the stamp below does not make a
region mean "exactly once": sharding a once-only side effect across the AIV
sub-lanes is the author's job, as is the lane rule for a `None`-region V→C
crossing ([Scopes and Placement](../../user/language/04-scopes.md)).

### Carrying region placement past the erasure (`core_placement`)

Erasing the wrappers loses the record of *where the author put a statement*, and
[`ExpandMixedKernel`](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) duplicates every `SHARED`
statement onto **both** lanes. A core-agnostic op in a region
(`pld.system.notify`, whose TNOTIFY declares no affinity) would land on the cube
lane too, where it can publish a signal before the vector lane's TPUT has landed
the data that signal releases.

So before splicing a region body out, this pass stamps
`attrs["core_placement"] = "aiv"` on the calls it is about to orphan, and
`ClassifyCallAffinity` reads it as the **placement authority**, resolving them to
`VECTOR`. The attr asserts a placement, so it is written only where the region is
what *decides* one:

| intrinsic affinity | stamped? | why |
| ------------------ | -------- | --- |
| `SHARED` **and** `set_no_duplicate()` (`pld.system.notify`) | **yes** | only the region places it, and duplication is wrong for it |
| `SHARED` but *not* marked (`pld.system.wait`) | no | pinning **removes** it from the cube lane — for a blocking op that is a miscompile |
| `VECTOR` | no | already the AIV lane, by its own memory spec |
| a **stated** lane (`tile.create`, `system.syncall(core_type=…)`) | no | placed by its own declaration, which a region does not outrank |
| `MIXED` (`aiv_shard` / `aic_gather`, C/V `tile.move`) | no | these *are* the transfer — tpush on one lane, tpop on the other |
| `CUBE` | no | rejected in a region by check (a) |

A mixed comm kernel therefore gains exactly one attr, on the notify. The stamp
buys one thing — the op is not copied onto the **cube** lane; it says nothing
about how many AIV sub-lanes run it. The walk descends into compound statements,
is idempotent, and runs on each arm's **final** statements.

**Lifetime: this pass → pass 21, no further.** `ExpandMixedKernel` strips the
attr once consumed; `Call::attrs_` is a reflection `UsualField` and the printer
serialises attrs open-world, so an un-stripped stamp would surface in every later
pass dump and `assert_structural_equal`. Same lifecycle as `pipeline_stages`.

A function-level AUTO split and explicit `pl.split_aiv` regions are **mutually
exclusive**, enforced at [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](08-outline_incore_scopes.md)
while the scope's `split_` and its regions are both still visible; use
`optimizations=[pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)]` to size the pipe without
annotating a split.

Three region body shapes are handled, selected by the region's `split_` mode:

- **Data-parallel, full-width body** (`UpDown` / `LeftRight`, no explicit boundary
  op): the region body holds full-width vector compute. The region path injects a
  per-region `subblock_idx`, routes the vector ops through the shared
  `split_axis::ProcessStmts` halving machinery (region-scoped), and validates the
  per-region transpose hazard. This is the paradigm the auto-converged form
  produces.
- **Data-parallel, explicit boundary body** (`UpDown` / `LeftRight` with
  `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` already present): the user manually sharded
  the cube tile and wrote the vector compute on the per-lane half, so the body is
  **already** in half-width form. The region path detects this
  (`RegionBodyHasExplicitBoundary`) and **splices the body through unchanged**.
  Re-halving would double-shard — a downstream Acc→Vec move misread as a fresh
  cube→vector boundary and rewritten to a second `aiv_shard` — orphaning a halved
  Acc memref and crashing PTO codegen. `ExpandMixedKernel` folds the boundary into
  `tpush`/`tpop` as for a hand-authored split_aiv kernel.
- **Task-parallel body** (`None`): **no split axis** — both AIV lanes run the
  **full** body for disjoint work the author dispatches via `aiv_id`. The body is
  **spliced through unchanged** (no halving, no offset localization, no injected
  `subblock_idx`; the author's `aiv_id = get_subblock_idx()` already carries the
  lane). `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` are **accepted** here: with no split
  axis they cross the boundary without splitting, and `split=0` preserves the
  shape. `ValidateMixedExplicitRegion` is skipped — everything is full width. The
  function is still stamped `split_aiv`, so `SplitVectorKernel` dispatches it to
  **both** AIV lanes (`dual_aiv_dispatch`) rather than the lane-0-only replay;
  both therefore push on a V→C crossing, into one shared slot with no
  arbitration, so the cube receives an unspecified one of the two values unless
  the author keeps it lane-uniform. Use this mode when the tiles cannot be halved
  or a reduction must stay full width.

### What may appear inside an explicit-boundary region

Because that body is spliced through **unchanged**, every vector op in it must
already be per-lane — an op left at full width would run identically on both AIV
lanes. `ValidateMixedExplicitRegion` enforces this and rejects the region with an
actionable error naming the offending ops. A tile-producing op is accepted when
any of the following holds:

| Accepted | Why |
| -------- | --- |
| Consumes a `tile.aiv_shard` result defined in **this** region (transitively) | It is in the half-width dataflow by construction. |
| A pure generator — `tile.full` / `tile.ci` / `tile.random` (and `tile.create`, which classifies `SHARED` and so was never reportable anyway) | Its result is a function of its attributes only: it reads no tile and no memory, so per-lane replication is correct at whatever extent the author wrote. |
| An address-carrying op — `tile.load` / `tile.slice` / `tile.extract` / `tile.gather_row` — whose **read address** references the region's `aiv_id` | The author localized it explicitly, e.g. `data[base + aiv_id * HALF : ...]`. Only the read-offset args count (`tile.load` arg 1, `tile.slice` arg 2, `tile.extract` args 1–2, `tile.gather_row` arg 3 = `src_offset`) — a lane reference in a `shape`, a `valid_shape`, or a *destination* slot does not move the window, so it does not admit. |

The scan is seeded **per region** and makes one forward pass in program order, so
it recognises only a boundary result defined in the region it is scanning. A
`tile.aiv_shard` result reaching the region from elsewhere — produced in a sibling
region, or arriving through a loop `iter_arg` on the back edge — is invisible to
it, and the consumer would be reported as full width even though the value really
is per-lane. Both shapes are rejected 12 passes earlier by the `AivSplitValid`
verifier (checks (i) and (j), see [99-verifier.md](99-verifier.md)), which is what
keeps that false positive off the author's screen; this scan therefore only ever
meets a same-region dataflow, which is the domain it was written for.

`tile.gather_row` is the DMA case: being DPS it carries **two** offsets, and only
`src_offset` decides whether the lanes do different work — a lane-derived
`src_offset` means each lane pulls its own scattered GM rows (admitted), while a
lane-derived `dst_offset` over a lane-invariant `src_offset` means both lanes fetch
the *same* rows into different slots of a full-width accumulator (still reported).

Anything else that classifies `VECTOR` is reported. A generator is accepted for
**itself only** — `z = pl.full([FULL, N]); y = pl.add(z, z)` still rejects on `y`,
because a full-width generator must not vouch for its consumers. And the lane
reference is trusted **only** on an addressing op, so
`pl.set_validshape(full_width_tile, 1, aiv_id * HALF)` cannot launder a full tile
into the region.

The guard proves *intent*, not *extent*: a load at a lane-strided offset but a
full-width extent is accepted, and the two lanes then read overlapping windows —
the same trust already extended to `tile.store`, whose lane-dependent offset the
pass never checks.

Because the region is built via the generic `BeginScope`/`EndScope` and is
non-outlined, it can be **nested** inside a `pl.range` / `pl.pipeline` loop or an
`if`; the region path recurses into compound statements to lower every region while
preserving the surrounding control flow.

### Per-lane scattered gather

`pl.gather_row` is the only op that reads GM at an arbitrary **runtime** offset, so
it is how a paged/top-k row set is sharded across the two AIV lanes: each lane
assembles half the tile in UB and `pl.aic_gather` hands the reassembled tile to the
cube.

```python
with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, name_hint="sparse_kv",
           allow_early_resolve=True):                           # see the ring note below
    for aiv in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
        ub = pl.full([64, 512], dtype=pl.BF16, value=0.0)       # per-lane HALF extent
        for k in pl.range(64):
            src = pl.cast(pl.read(idx, [aiv * 64 + k]), pl.INDEX)
            ub = pl.gather_row(ub, pool, [k, 0], [src, 0], [1, 512])   # lane-derived src_offset
        kv = pl.aic_gather(ub)                                  # V2C -> [128, 512] in Mat
    out[0:16, 0:128] = pl.matmul(q, kv, b_trans=True, out_dtype=pl.FP32)
```

Two authoring rules make this work:

- **Write the accumulator at the half extent.** `pl.full` is a generator, accepted
  at whatever extent you give it and never joining the half-width dataflow on its
  own. The gather is admitted on its lane-derived `src_offset`, and the guard proves
  *intent*, not *extent* — so a full-extent accumulator would be gathered back to
  `2 x FULL` and mismatch downstream.
- **Watch the cross-core ring.** The V2C ring reserves `slot_size x slot_num` bytes
  of the consuming core's memory (L1 for V2C, UB for C2V), where `slot_size` is the
  **full** tile the consumer pops (`128 x 512 x 2 = 131072` here) and `slot_num`
  defaults to **2** — 256 KB of a 512 KB L1, which a kernel pushing once per
  invocation does not need to exceed. `pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)` retunes it
  in either direction; grow it too far and `AllocateMemoryAddr` reports the
  overflow.

`pl.aiv_shard` is **not** an alternative to the half-extent `pl.full` here: it is
the C→V transfer and needs an `Acc` operand, so it cannot shard a value the
vector lane produced itself.

### Regions must be scope-free

Region lowering recurses into `ForStmt` / `WhileStmt` / `IfStmt` / `SeqStmts` but
deliberately **not** into a `ScopeStmt`: a scope carries outlining and
name-visibility semantics that region-local halving must not reach through. Every
region must therefore already be scope-free when this pass runs — normally
guaranteed by [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](08-outline_incore_scopes.md) (pass 8), which
lifts the enclosing `InCore` scope into its own function.

Pass 8 outlines scopes only out of `Opaque` / `Orchestration` functions, so a
scope standing inside a function declared `pl.FunctionType.InCore` reaches this
pass intact. The scope has to be **author-written** — the parser adds none of its
own there, emitting a top-level region bare so that a printed `*_incore_0`
reparses to the same IR, and authoring a region in such a function at all is
rejected earlier by [`AivSplitValid`](99-verifier.md) check (h):

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)   # pass 8 skips this function
def f(self, a: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
      c: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]:
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):                   # not outlined
        for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):
            base = aiv_id * 64
            c = pl.store(pl.exp(pl.load(a, [base, 0], [64, 128])), [base, 0], c)
    return c
```

After lowering, `LowerExplicitRegionFunction` re-scans the body and rejects any
surviving region with a `ValueError` pointing at the `pl.split_aiv` line. Drop
the redundant scope, or use plain `@pl.function` / `@pl.jit` (Opaque) so pass 8
outlines it.

The re-scan then rejects any **other** surviving `ScopeStmt` too, covering the
mirror case: a scope nested *inside* a region body. There the region itself is
consumed, so the first check passes — yet the inner walks (`LowerStmts`,
`CheckNoCubeTileHalved`, `ScanRegionHalfWidth`) step over the scope rather than
entering it, and the vector ops inside would be spliced out full-width with both
AIV lanes computing the whole tile. Unreachable from the DSL (pass 8 lifts a
`with pl.at(...)` inside a region into its own function, and check (h) rejects
authoring a region in an InCore function the outliner did not produce), so it
guards IR that skips pass 8 — hand-built, or a deserialized `.pto`.

The guard is also what makes the `split_aiv_region_validated` stamp trustworthy:
the attrs are written only once every region has actually been consumed, so
[`ExpandMixedKernel`](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) skipping its own func-mode check
on the strength of that stamp is always backed by a real per-region validation.
Without it a scope-nested region passed through unlowered *and* un-validated
while still being stamped "region validated", and the failure surfaced much later
as an internal assertion in PTO codegen (`SplitAivScopeStmt reached PTO codegen`).

## Split-axis dispatch

| `SplitMode` (int) | Split axis | Vector sub-region halved on |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `None` (0) | — (no split axis) | nothing — task-parallel; tiles stay FULL, `aiv_id` dispatches both lanes |
| `UpDown` (1) | dim 0 (height) | rows |
| `LeftRight` (2) | dim 1 (width) | cols |

`SplitDimension(mode)` returns `0` for `UpDown`, `1` for `LeftRight`
(`split_axis_utils`); it is **not** called for `None` (the region path branches on
`None` first — there is no axis to derive).

### Split mode vs pto-isa split code

`SplitMode` names the axis the author picked. The `split` attr that reaches the
device names something narrower — pto-isa's `TileSplitAxis`, which also says how
the two lanes' **runtime** extents relate, because that is how the consumer finds
lane 1's band inside the FIFO slot (`popVecTileFromGMFiFo`):

| Code | pto-isa | Lane 1's band starts at | Requires |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| 0 | `TILE_NO_SPLIT` | — | single reader |
| 1 / 2 | `TILE_UP_DOWN` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT` | `e1 * pitch` | `e0 == e1` |
| 3 / 4 | `TILE_UP_DOWN_ODD` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT_ODD` | `(e1 + 1) * pitch` | `e0 == e1 + 1` |

The two vocabularies live on different ops:

- **`tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` carry the MODE** (`0` / `1` / `2`). This
  pass stamps `int(mode)` — the author's axis, nothing more.
- **`tile.tpush_*` / `tile.tpop_*` / `system.tfree_*` carry the CODE** (`0`..`4`),
  chosen by [ExpandMixedKernel](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) from that mode plus the
  full-width tile's extents (`split_axis::ShardSplitCode`) when it folds the
  boundary into a transport pair. PTO codegen prints it verbatim as `{split = N}`.

An odd split axis reaches the odd codes in two ways, and the halving treats both
identically: `ComputeHalfDimSize` gives BOTH lanes the **ceil** half as their
physical box, and the per-lane valid extent carries the raggedness.

| Boundary tile | Lane boxes | Lane extents | Code |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---- |
| `[17, 128]`, fully valid | `[9, 128]` | 9 / 8 | 3 |
| `[16, 128]`, valid `[15, 128]` | `[8, 128]` | 8 / 7 | 3 |
| `[16, 128]`, fully valid | `[8, 128]` | 8 / 8 | 1 |

## Partially-valid operands across the boundary

A crossing value whose `valid_shape` is short of its physical box is a kernel's
ragged tail. The Cube→Vector FIFO pins the transported **column** extent to the
physical one and leaves the **row** extent free (derivation and ISA references:
[PTO codegen](../codegen/00-pto_codegen.md)). A narrowing on the *split axis* is
what makes an extent per-lane — lane `L` holds `clamp(V - L*half, 0, half)` — so
which mode is ragged decides which field has to carry it:

The table is the **shard's** (Cube→Vector) contract; `aic_gather` follows the
geometric rule at the end of this section instead.

| Ragged axis | Mode | Extent is | Carrier | Status |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| rows (split axis) | `UpDown` | per-lane | TPOP `valid_row` operand | **supported** when the lanes are placeable (below) |
| cols (non-split) | `UpDown` | shared, static | full-box transport + static `pto.treshape` | supported |
| rows (non-split) | `LeftRight` | shared, static | TPOP `valid_row` operand | supported |
| cols (split axis) | `LeftRight` | per-lane | none | **rejected** |
| cols, runtime-valued | either | shared, dynamic | none (`treshape` takes no operands) | **rejected** |
| rows, runtime-valued | `UpDown` | per-lane, dynamic | the boundary op's FULL box + the first consumer's `valid_shape` | supported (see the note below) |
| rows per-lane **and** cols narrowed | `UpDown` | both | none (`treshape` rewrites both axes) | **rejected** |

`ReshapeSplitAxis` can only ceil-halve the split-axis extent (the lane index is
not part of an op's type function). `LocalizeExplicitBoundaryValid` repairs that
guess here, where the region's `aiv_id` is in scope, and carries the per-lane
extent to consumers that pass `valid_shape` through; one that reshapes the
logical rectangle is rejected with its span. The AUTO arm applies the same *extent* repair through
`LocalizeShardValidForLane`, but not the store guard below — its consumers are
rebuilt by the halving walk rather than by this one.

- **The two lanes' extents must be placeable.** The split-axis extent is not a
  free field: pto-isa derives lane 1's band from the popped tile's own valid
  extent — `e1` cells in (`TILE_UP_DOWN`) or `e1 + 1` (the `_ODD` modes). So the
  placeable shapes are exactly `e0 == e1` (even code), `e0 == e1 + 1` (odd code)
  and `e1 == 0` (lane 1 pops nothing, so its band is never dereferenced — the
  even code stays exact). The box partition does not guarantee that for a ragged
  boundary — 13 of a 16-row box gives 8 and 5 — which is what the balanced
  partition below is for. When it does not apply, `ShardSplitCode` reports the
  extents instead, naming what would work.
- **A runtime split-axis valid extent pops the FULL box.** The split code is a
  compile-time attr, but which one the lanes need depends on their *runtime*
  extents: 12 of a 16-row axis leaves them at 8 and 4, 16 leaves them at 8 and 8.
  No code is right for both, so the boundary op does not carry a per-lane extent
  at all — `LocalizeExplicitBoundaryValid` gives it the full box
  (`split_axis::WithFullSplitAxisValid`) and moves the lane's extent onto the
  first consumer. That pairs exactly with the even code: the producer transports
  the full physical box, so lane 1's band sits at the box half and the even code
  points there, whatever the extent turns out to be. Confirmed on a2a3 for every
  extent 1..16 of a 16-row boundary. The [pto-isa
  pop](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pto-isa/issues/263) does place lane 1 at
  the popped tile's own extent, as its source reads — the earlier measurement
  that suggested otherwise came from a probe whose operands were uniform
  constants, which makes every row and column of the product identical and any
  band offset indistinguishable.
- **The same ROW extent on a hand-written `tile.tpop_from_aic` is still
  misplaced.** `SplitVectorKernel`'s halving localizes a declared `valid_shape`
  onto the pop itself, where pto-isa reads it as the band offset. Widening only
  the pop does not fix that path: its consumers inherit the author's declaration
  and then write partial destinations out of a full source, which measures worse
  on device. The xfailing params of
  `tests/st/runtime/cross_core/test_cross_core_split_parity.py` record the regime
  this affects: `half < V < box` on `UP_DOWN`.
- **A narrowed COLUMN extent is rejected on every path.** It has no carrier at
  all — the slot is written at the producer's physical column pitch while the pop
  rebuilds its geometry from the tile's own `validCol` — and on `LeftRight` it is
  the split axis, so it would have to be per-lane. `CheckSplitBoundaryCarriesValid`
  (`src/ir/op/tile_ops/cross_core.cpp`) owns that contract; it runs both in the
  boundary op's deduction and from `ShardSplitCode`, so a hand-written
  `tile.tpush_to_aiv` / `tile.tpop_from_aic` pair is held to it too.
- **An empty lane's store is guarded.** A lane the ragged extent does not reach
  has extent `0`, and a zero-row `TSTORE` is outside pto-isa's contract
  (`TSTORE_IMPL` asserts `GetValidRow() > 0`). The store gets a runtime
  `extent > 0` guard; `tpop` and `tfree` stay **unconditional** — both lanes
  occupy a slot and both must release it.
- **The gather is limited by geometry, not the DMA.** A V2C pop lands in an NZ
  Mat tile (`TLoadGm2L1Nd2nz`), which reads no valid extent at all. What limits
  `aic_gather` is placement: lane `l` sits at offset `l*half`, so the joined data
  `[0, v0) ∪ [half, half + v1)` is a rectangle only when the bands abut. That
  rule is enforced **in this pass**, not in the deducer, which runs before the
  per-lane extents exist and could only judge the join on its own ceil-div guess.
  A gather fed by a localized shard is typed exactly — the bands always abut, so
  the joined extent is the pre-shard `V` — and only a partial that both lanes
  share is rejected. The same geometry is why the gather has **no odd form**:
  `GatherSplitCode` always returns an even code and rejects a boundary whose
  lanes would differ (pad the axis and narrow the cube-side result instead).

## Balancing a ragged boundary across the lanes

The split partitions the split axis between the lanes: lane `L` owns
`[L*S, L*S + S)` of it. Two partitions are possible, and they differ only when
the boundary tile is ragged:

| Partition | `S` | Lane extents for a `[16, …]` box valid to 13 | Placeable? |
| --------- | --- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| box (default) | `ceil(box / 2)` = 8 | 8 and 5 | no |
| **valid** (rebalanced) | `ceil(V / 2)` = 7 | 7 and 6 | yes — `TILE_UP_DOWN_ODD` |

The box partition is universal: it works for every tile in the region whatever
its valid extent, which is why it is the default. What it cannot do is keep the
lanes within one cell of each other, and that is exactly what the transport
needs (see the placeability rule above). Balancing the VALID region instead
makes `e0 - e1 ∈ {0, 1}` by construction — and splits the real work evenly
rather than leaving lane 1 the remainder.

`split_axis::ResolveLaneStride` runs over the body before it is rewritten and
returns the balanced stride only when it is both needed and sound:

- at least one Cube→Vector boundary, all agreeing on the same static
  `(box, valid)` on the split axis, with `ceil(V / 2) < ceil(box / 2)`
  (otherwise the box partition already balances);
- no Vector→Cube boundary (the gather re-joins the lanes positionally at their
  own extents, which only abut when they are equal);
- every other split-axis tile in the body derives from that boundary — a tile
  with an independent origin (a `tile.load`, a generator) spans the FULL box,
  which the balanced partition would not cover.

Anything else keeps the box partition. The stride then threads through the whole
halving — offsets (`AdjustOffsets`), per-lane valid extents
(`LocalizeValidDimForSplit`), the shard's own type
(`LocalizeShardValidForLane`) — while the physical box stays `ceil(box / 2)`, so
buffers and slot sizes are unchanged. It is stamped on the boundary op as
`lane_stride=S` so [ExpandMixedKernel](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) derives the
transport code from the same partition. A `tile.reshape` that migrates the split
axis inside a rebalanced body is rejected: a migrated axis carries its own half,
which cannot express a partition balanced on another axis.

```python
# 13 of 16 valid rows, UP_DOWN. Lane 0 takes rows 0-6, lane 1 rows 7-12.
popped: pl.Tile[[8, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec,
                pl.TileView(valid_shape=[pl.min(pl.max(13, aiv_id * 7) - aiv_id * 7, 7), 128])
               ] = pl.tile.aiv_shard(qk, split=1, lane_stride=7)
out_store = pl.tile.store(popped, [0 + aiv_id * 7, 0], out_0)
```

Explicit `pl.split_aiv` regions are never rebalanced: their per-lane offsets are
the author's own (`out[aiv_id * HALF : ...]`), and the compiler must not
partition the data differently from the way the region indexes it.

## Algorithm

`LowerFunction` rewrites one mixed `InCore` function:

```text
1. split_dim = SplitDimension(mode); the boundary op carries int(mode).
2. InjectSubblockIdx(func, is_aiv=true) prepends
       subblock_idx = tile.get_subblock_idx()
   to the body (fresh name if 'subblock_idx' is taken).
2a. ResolveLaneStride(body, split_dim) picks the partition: the balanced
    ceil(V / 2) for a body that is one ragged crossing, else null (the box
    partition). It threads through every offset / per-lane extent below.
3. LowerStmts walks the flat body:

   Boundary tile.move (ClassifyMoveDirection):
     CUBE_TO_VECTOR — replace the move with
         tile.aiv_shard(full_cube_tile, split=int(mode)[, lane_stride=S])  -> HALF
       The deduced HALF type already carries the consuming-lane memory
       (Vec): the split deducer leaves memory_space null and
       OpRegistry::Create fills it from tile.aiv_shard's set_output_memory
       declaration, shared with the explicit form. Seed it into tile_vars (its half
       extent) and record the old->new var rebind. The cube source (the
       matmul / Acc result) stays FULL.
     VECTOR_TO_CUBE — insert
         tile.aic_gather(half_vector_tile, split=int(mode))  -> FULL
       resolving the source to its halved var so the gather doubles
       HALF -> FULL, then keep the original cube-placement move on the
       gathered FULL tile (named "<dest>_mat" so ExpandMixedKernel's V->C
       boundary names its synthesized tpop after it).

   Affinity gate (ClassifyCallAffinity):
     VECTOR-affine leaf — route the single statement through
       split_axis::ProcessStmts({stmt}, ..., is_aiv=true): the SAME machinery
       the deleted SplitVectorKernel driver used. Halves tile.load /
       tile.store / tile.slice / tile.reshape / compute results on split_dim,
       localizes offsets per subblock, tracks halved vars in tile_vars.
     CUBE-affine leaf — passed through FULL, never halved.

   ForStmt / IfStmt — recurse into the body for vector content.

4. CheckNoCubeTileHalved re-walks the rebuilt body and asserts no CUBE-affine
   op consumes or produces a tile in tile_vars (the affinity gate must never
   leak a halved tile into a cube operand) — INTERNAL_CHECK on failure.
5. transform_utils::Substitute applies var_replacements; DeepClone detaches
   shared sub-trees.
6. WithSplitAivAttrs stamps split + split_aiv (dropping any prior split /
   split_aiv / dual_aiv_dispatch entries).
```

The per-op vector halving (shape halved on the split axis, offset localized by
`subblock_idx * half`, `tile.slice` static-shape-arg halving in lockstep with
the result type, rank-1-load reshape sliced per lane, reduce-on-split-axis
rejected, singleton split-dim preserved, loop `iter_arg`/`return_var`
tracking) is all produced by `split_axis::ProcessStmts` / `ProcessStmt` —
documented in detail in the shared machinery; the same facts are exercised by
`tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_lower_auto_vector_split.py`.

Automatic halving rejects the root generators `tile.ci` and `tile.random` when
their split dimension is non-singleton. Their generated values depend on
position, so changing only the result type is insufficient: a correct rewrite
also needs lane-specific shape and generator state, which this pass does not
synthesize. Move the operation outside the automatically-halved split region.
Singleton split dimensions and already-half-width explicit-boundary regions
remain unchanged.

## The affinity gate

Only **vector** work is halved; cube work stays full. Affinity is decided by
`core_affinity::ClassifyCallAffinity` (memory-space driven): an op producing or
consuming a `Vec` tile is `VECTOR`; matmul operands and the Acc/Mat cube result
are `CUBE`. `tile.aiv_shard` is the seam — FULL cube tile in, HALF vector tile
out — and `CheckNoCubeTileHalved` is the backstop.

## Example — cube→vector boundary, vector region halved (UpDown)

A mixed kernel: a cube tile (`Mat`) crosses to `Vec`, a vector `add` runs on
it, the result is stored.

**Before** (post-InferTileMemorySpace mixed `InCore`):

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore, attrs={"split": pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN})
def split_auto(qk: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat],
               out_0: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]]):
    popped: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.move(qk, target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
    y: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.add(popped, popped)
    return pl.store(y, [0, 0], out_0)
```

**After**:

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore,
             attrs={"split": pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN, "split_aiv": True})
def split_auto(qk, out_0):
    subblock_idx: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = pl.tile.get_subblock_idx()
    popped: pl.Tile[[64, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.aiv_shard(qk, split=1)  # C->V, HALF
    y: pl.Tile[[64, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.add(popped, popped)
    return pl.store(y, [0 + subblock_idx * 64, 0], out_0)
```

The cube operand `qk` stays `[128, 128]`; the vector sub-region is halved to
`[64, 128]` and the store offset is localized per subblock.

## Example — vector→cube boundary stays full (UpDown)

A V→C `tile.move` becomes `tile.aic_gather`; the cube placement move on the
gathered tile keeps the FULL `[128, 128]` `Mat` shape — the cube side never
sees a halved tile:

```python
# `v` is the per-lane HALF the affinity gate produced, e.g. [64, 128].
gathered_mat: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.aic_gather(v, split=1)
gathered:     pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.move(gathered_mat,
                                                                      target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
```

**The operand must be a per-lane half.** `tile.aic_gather` is declared
HALF → FULL, so the gather doubles `[64, 128] → [128, 128]`, which is exactly the
FULL result type the cube placement move keeps. That agreement is a
*precondition*, not a guarantee: a VECTOR value can reach the boundary un-halved
— a `Vec` parameter used directly, or a tile whose split dim is a singleton the
affinity gate deliberately preserves. Doubling such an operand would produce a
`[256, 128]` gather feeding a move still typed `[128, 128]`, contradicting
`tile.move`'s shape-preserving contract and yielding IR that does not survive
print→parse. There is no correct gather for a value with no half, so the pass
**rejects** it with an actionable `ValueError`:

```text
LowerAutoVectorSplit: the V->C boundary tile.move here carries a full-width
vector operand 'vec'. tile.aic_gather reassembles the two AIV lanes' per-lane
halves into the full tile the cube expects, so its operand must be a value the
split halving produced (a tile.load / tile.slice / elementwise result inside the
vector sub-region). An un-halved value has no half to gather — either derive the
per-lane half first (load or slice the value inside the split function) and move
that to the cube side, or, if the split axis is a singleton that cannot be
halved, keep the value on the vector side.
```

**The gather follows the operand's split axis, not the function's.** A
`tile.reshape` can migrate the split axis — the rms_norm `[N, 1] ↔ [1, N]` column
reshape moves it from dim 0 to dim 1 — and `TileInfo::split_dim` tracks where it
ended up. The gather is emitted with the `split` encoding of *that* dim
(`dim 0 → 1`, `dim 1 → 2`), so a `[1, 8]` lane-local operand under an `UpDown`
function gathers to `[1, 16]` via `split=2`, matching the move. Doubling the
function axis instead would yield `[2, 8]`. A tracked split dim outside `{0, 1}`
cannot be expressed as a `split` attr on a 2D gather and is rejected.

The gather result is `Mat`, not `Vec`: the declared type of a boundary op names
the **consuming** lane's space, and AIC pops a V→C transfer into L1. (`Vec` would
name the *producing* lane, contradicting the mirror op `tile.aiv_shard`, which
declares the vector-side `Vec` for its cube-produced operand.) The cube placement
move that follows is what puts the tile in its final operand space — `Mat → Left`
for a matmul operand; the `Mat → Mat` shown here is a no-op that survives only
because the pass preserves the author's original move.
