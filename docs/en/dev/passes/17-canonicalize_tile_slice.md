# CanonicalizeTileSlice Pass

Lowers a `tile.slice` into the canonical `tile.extract` form so that movement is unified on `pto.textract` — Mat-resident slices (folded into matmul / `tile.extract` consumers), Vec slices whose lazy materialization would corrupt their source (materialized for the `tile.col_expand_*` family, issues #1640 and #2010), and unaligned Vec subviews (issue #1789).

## Overview

A `tile.slice` whose result tile is `Mem.Mat` is a legal high-level "sub-window of a Mat tile" construct. [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](13-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) emits one per batch page when it unrolls a `tile.batch_matmul`: the page offset is `batch_index * page_rows`, and for a leading-dim-1 batch that offset is 0 and the window covers the whole tile — but it is still a `tile.slice`.

PTO ISA supports `pto.subview` on Mat as a zero-copy alias (no data movement), so a standalone Mat slice is valid when its consumer accepts the subview SSA directly. However, consumers that trigger lazy materialization (via `MaterializeSubviewOperandIfNeeded`) would attempt a `loc=mat → loc=mat` `pto.textract` — an unsupported L1→L1 DMA path on targets such as Ascend 910C. This pass eliminates Mat-resident `tile.slice` nodes whose consumers it can canonicalize (extract/matmul) by folding the offset into each consumer for efficiency, then drops the now-dead slice. A Mat slice with a consumer that is not canonicalized (e.g. `tile.move`) is left intact — it lowers to a valid `pto.subview`.

The pass also canonicalizes a **Vec** `tile.slice` consumed by the `tile.col_expand_*` family (issues #1640, #2010). Those ops cannot read a `pto.subview` operand, so codegen lazily materializes the slice via `pto.textract` into the slice's own result buffer — and because `tile.slice` inherits its source's memory, that buffer sits **inside the still-live source**. The extract therefore runs in place over its own input, which is only safe when it is an **identity copy**. Two conditions must hold:

| Condition | Why it can fail |
| --------- | --------------- |
| The destination **address** is right | `AllocateMemoryAddr` folds a `ConstInt` offset into `base + off`, but a **dynamic** offset cannot be encoded as a `ConstInt` address and falls back to the bare source base — the extracted window lands on the source's row 0 (#1640). |
| The destination **layout** matches | The slice's buffer is dense (row pitch = slice cols) while the source window is strided (row pitch = source cols). These coincide only for a **contiguous** window: a single row, or one spanning every column. A column slice of a multi-row tile (`t[:, a:b]`) repacks strided → dense on top of its own source and destroys it — only row 0 survives, because its dense destination happens to equal its source address (#2010). |

When either condition fails, the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(..., target_memory=Vec)`, whose result gets its own non-inherited allocation. `tile.extract` is registered `not_inplace_safe()`, so [`MemoryReuse`](34-memory_reuse.md) cannot place that fresh buffer back onto the source either. A slice whose materialization *is* an identity copy is left untouched, so it keeps sharing the source buffer rather than paying for a duplicate allocation.

Independently, PTO vector instructions require tile operand base addresses to be 32-byte aligned. A zero-copy Vec slice starts at

```text
base + (off_row * base_cols + off_col) * storage_bits
```

so an FP32 column slice at `[:, 1:2]` starts only 4 bytes past an aligned allocation. Feeding that subview directly to an ordinary vector op such as `tile.muls` can hang the device (#1789). The pass therefore replaces an unaligned Vec slice operand with a fresh `tile.extract(..., target_memory=Vec)`. The new allocation is aligned; provably aligned slices remain zero-copy. Dynamic offsets are also kept zero-copy when scalar SSA arithmetic proves that their known multiple produces a 32-byte-aligned row or column displacement.

**Pipeline position**: After [`AutoTileMatmulL0`](16-auto_tile_matmul_l0.md) (so the per-iter `tile.extract`s that read the batch-page slices already exist), before [`InferTileMemorySpace`](18-infer_tile_memory_space.md).

**Requirements**: `SSAForm`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `IncoreTileOps`, `TileOps2D`, `NormalizedStmtStructure`.

**Produces**: same as required (property-preserving rewrite).

**Invalidates**: nothing.

**When to use**: Always, as part of the default tile-stage pipeline. The pass is a no-op when no canonical `tile.slice` exists.

## Algorithm

For each InCore-typed function, in three phases:

1. **Collect** — index every `AssignStmt` whose value is a `tile.slice(src, shape, offset)` in canonical 3-argument form. A slice whose `src` is itself a recorded slice is peeled, accumulating the offset, so each entry resolves to a non-slice base tile plus a total `(off_row, off_col)`. Direct `ConstInt` SSA definitions and their plain aliases are resolved before this analysis, so a literal offset does not become artificially dynamic after `ConvertToSSA`. Scalar SSA definitions are also retained for modular alignment proofs: for example, `block_idx * 32` is dynamic but has a statically known 32-element multiple. Slices carrying `valid_shape` / `drop_dims` (4–5 arguments) are not plain windows and are skipped.

2. **Rewrite consumers** — for each slice:
   - **`tile.extract(slice, ir, ic, shape)`** → `tile.extract(base, ir + off_row, ic + off_col, shape)`. The extract reads the slice's source directly; the index add is constant-folded when both terms are `ConstInt`.
   - **`tile.matmul` / `tile.matmul_acc` / `tile.matmul_bias` operand** (Mat slices only) → the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Left|Right)` — `Left` for the lhs operand, `Right` for the rhs. (The `tile.matmul_acc` accumulator operand is `Acc`-resident and never a Mat slice, so it is not rewritten here; it is instead checked for L0C contiguity — see [Acc accumulator windows](#acc-accumulator-windows).)
   - **`tile.col_expand_*` operand** (Vec slices only) → when the lazy `pto.textract` would not be an identity copy — a dynamic offset, or a window that is not contiguous in the base tile (more than one row *and* narrower than the base) — the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Vec)`. Both operands are checked. Contiguous const-offset windows are left untouched.
   - **Ordinary call operand** (Vec slices only, in either an `AssignStmt` or an `EvalStmt`) → compute `(base_byte_offset * 8 + (off_row * base_cols + off_col) * storage_bits) mod 256`. A known concrete MemRef byte offset is included before the modulo calculation; the allocation-planning sentinel is treated as an aligned root, while a non-constant base offset is not statically provable. Scalar SSA definitions are followed through aliases, addition/subtraction, and multiplication to prove aligned dynamic multiples. If the result is nonzero or cannot be proved, replace the operand by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Vec)`. `tile.slice` itself is skipped so chained views can be peeled, and `tile.extract` uses the direct folding rule above.
   - **SSA escape** (Vec slices only) → an unaligned slice assigned through a plain alias is materialized at the alias definition. An unaligned loop initializer is materialized before the loop and substituted through its `IterArg`; an unaligned value carried by `yield` is materialized before the yield. This prevents aliases and loop-carried identities from bypassing the ordinary-call lookup.

3. **Drop dead slices** — a `tile.slice` whose result no longer has any use is removed. A chained slice only becomes dead once the slice consuming it is dropped, so this iterates to a fixpoint (bounded by the slice count). A slice still used at the end had a consumer this pass does not canonicalize; it is left intact — no regression versus the pre-pass IR.

The pass is a `FunctionPass`; functions are returned unchanged when no canonical `tile.slice` is present.

## Examples

### Slice folded into `tile.extract`

The offset-0 full-shape slice [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](13-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) emits for a leading-dim-1 batch operand:

**Before**:

```python
lhs_slice: pl.Tile[[32, 512], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(x_mat, [32, 512], [0, 0])
a:         pl.Tile[[32, 256], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Left] = pl.tile.extract(
    lhs_slice, 0, ko, shape=[32, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
```

**After** (slice dropped; extract reads the loaded Mat tile directly):

```python
a: pl.Tile[[32, 256], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Left] = pl.tile.extract(
    x_mat, 0, ko, shape=[32, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
```

A non-zero page offset folds into the extract index — e.g. a slice at `[32, 0]` turns `extract(slice, 0, ko, ...)` into `extract(x_mat, 32, ko, ...)`.

### Slice folded into a `tile.matmul` operand

When `AutoTileMatmulL0` leaves a matmul untiled (already L0-sized), its Mat-slice operands are converted directly:

**Before**:

```python
lhs_slice: pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(lhs_mat, [16, 256], [0, 0])
rhs_slice: pl.Tile[[256, 64], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(rhs_mat, [256, 64], [0, 0])
c:         pl.Tile[[16, 64],  pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Acc] = pl.tile.matmul(lhs_slice, rhs_slice)
```

**After**:

```python
lhs_left:  pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Left]  = pl.tile.extract(
    lhs_mat, 0, 0, shape=[16, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
rhs_right: pl.Tile[[256, 64], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Right] = pl.tile.extract(
    rhs_mat, 0, 0, shape=[256, 64], target_memory=pl.Mem.Right)
c:         pl.Tile[[16, 64],  pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Acc]   = pl.tile.matmul(lhs_left, rhs_right)
```

### Vec slice materialized into a `tile.col_expand_mul` operand (#1640)

A dynamic-offset slice of a local tile feeding `col_expand_mul` (the same rewrite applies to `col_expand_add`):

**Before**:

```python
row:    pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(local, [1, 256], [row_off, 0])
scaled: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(row, gamma_t)
```

**After** (slice dropped; the operand is materialized into a fresh, non-aliasing tile):

```python
row_ext: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    local, row_off, 0, shape=[1, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled:  pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(row_ext, gamma_t)
```

### Column slice of a multi-row Vec tile (#2010)

`t[:, 64:128]` on a `[16, 128]` tile is a *static*-offset slice, but its window is not contiguous — 16 rows, 64 of the source's 128 columns — so it is materialized too:

**Before**:

```python
hi:     pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(t, [16, 64], [0, 64])
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(hi, gamma_t)
```

**After**:

```python
hi_ext: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    t, 0, 64, shape=[16, 64], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(hi_ext, gamma_t)
```

Without the rewrite, `hi` allocates a dense `[16, 64]` buffer at `t + 256 B` — inside `t` — and the lazy `pto.textract` repacks `t`'s strided columns into it, overwriting `t` as it reads it. Only row 0 comes back correct, which is why the same construct is harmless on a single-row tile.

### Unaligned Vec column slice (#1789)

Column 1 of an FP32 tile begins four bytes past its aligned source allocation, so it cannot be used directly by `tile.muls`:

```python
head:   pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(local, [16, 1], [0, 1])
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.muls(head, 0.5)
```

The pass gives the vector operation an aligned, independently allocated tile:

```python
head_ext: pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    local, 0, 1, shape=[16, 1], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled:   pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.muls(head_ext, 0.5)
```

By contrast, FP32 column 8 is 32 bytes from the source base and remains a zero-copy slice. A dynamic row offset also remains zero-copy when the source row stride is 32-byte aligned.

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

**Properties**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/pass_properties.h` (`kCanonicalizeTileSliceProperties`)

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/canonicalize_tile_slice_pass.cpp`

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_canonicalize_tile_slice.py`

## Acc accumulator windows

The pass also **rejects** one shape it cannot repair. L0C is NZ: block
`(r_b, c_b)` of an `[M, N]` tile sits at `(c_b * M/16 + r_b) * fractal`. A window
is therefore contiguous only when it spans the parent's full row extent, or lies
inside a single 16-column block. A row window of a multi-block-column `Acc` tile
is strided, and the MAD writes its destination compactly from a bare pointer with
no destination stride, so every block column past the first lands in the wrong
row tile — silently, with only the first 16 columns of each row tile correct.

Unlike the Vec cases above there is no repair available: an `Acc` window cannot be
copied out and back, because nothing in the memory graph points into `Acc`. So a
matmul accumulator operand that is a non-contiguous `Acc` window raises a
`ValueError` naming the working spelling, which differs only by the sliced axis —
pack the accumulator as `[rows, N * tiles]` and slice columns.

The check is scoped by the op registry's `set_output_reuses_input`, so it covers
`tile.matmul_acc` / `tile.gemv_acc` / `tile.matmul_mx_acc` without naming them. It
stays silent on anything it cannot prove: a symbolic extent, a non-`Acc` layout,
or a dynamic column offset it cannot show stays inside one block.

This is a workaround for an upstream defect ([hw-native-sys/pto-isa#253](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pto-isa/issues/253)),
not a property of the DSL — `TMATMUL_ACC_IMPL` forwards the destination as a bare
`.data()` pointer and takes `m` from the left operand, so `TileRes::Rows` is never
read. If pto-isa gains a destination stride, this rejection should be relaxed or
deleted rather than kept.

## Scope

| Op | Action |
| -- | ------ |
| Mat-resident `tile.slice` (3-arg) feeding `tile.extract` | Folded into the extract; slice dropped |
| Mat-resident `tile.slice` (3-arg) feeding a matmul-family operand | Replaced by `tile.extract(target_memory=Left\|Right)`; slice dropped |
| Dynamic-offset Vec `tile.slice` (3-arg) feeding a `tile.col_expand_*` op | Replaced by `tile.extract(target_memory=Vec)`; slice dropped (#1640 — the address falls back to the bare source base) |
| Static-offset **non-contiguous** Vec `tile.slice` (multi-row *and* narrower than its base, e.g. `t[:, a:b]`) feeding a `tile.col_expand_*` op | Replaced by `tile.extract(target_memory=Vec)`; slice dropped (#2010 — the dense repack would run on top of its own live source) |
| Static-offset **contiguous** Vec `tile.slice` (single row, or full source width) feeding a `tile.col_expand_*` op | Untouched (the lazy textract is a safe identity copy; keeps sharing the source buffer) |
| Vec `tile.slice` feeding an ordinary call, inherited address not provably 32-byte aligned | Replaced by `tile.extract(target_memory=Vec)`; slice dropped (#1789) |
| Vec `tile.slice` feeding an ordinary call, inherited address provably 32-byte aligned | Untouched; keeps the zero-copy subview |
| Chained Mat `tile.slice` (slice of a slice) | Peeled; offsets accumulated |
| `tile.slice` with `valid_shape` / `drop_dims` | Skipped (not a plain window). If such a slice *also* fails either identity-copy condition above — a dynamic offset (e.g. a rank-reducing `t[i]`) or a non-contiguous window — while feeding a col-expand op, codegen rejects it with an `INTERNAL_CHECK` rather than emitting the source-corrupting materialization. The Acc accumulator check above still applies to such a slice: it needs only the physical base and offset, which are recorded for every window regardless of canonicalization eligibility |
| `Acc`-resident `tile.slice` used as a matmul **accumulator**, window neither spanning the parent's full row extent nor inside one 16-column block | **Rejected** with a `ValueError` naming the column-slice spelling — the MAD has no destination stride, so the write would silently land in the wrong row tile (pto-isa#253) |
| Other Left/Right/Acc-resident `tile.slice`, including a *contiguous* Acc accumulator window | Untouched (no matching consumer) |
| Functions with no canonical `tile.slice` | Returned unchanged |
