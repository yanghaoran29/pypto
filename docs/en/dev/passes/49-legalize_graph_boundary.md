# LegalizeGraphBoundary Pass

Makes every `FunctionType::Graph` function legal for the `host_build_graph`
runtime to record and replay: hoists the boundary scalars a Graph body derives,
the boundary views it takes and the intermediates it allocates out to its call
sites, and rejects the boundaries the runtime would decline to cache.

## Overview

The `host_build_graph` runtime records a Graph function's task topology on its
first call and replays that recording afterwards. Replay patches only two
things: the addresses of the boundary tensors, and the values of the boundary
scalars. Everything else — node count, shapes, dependency edges, block counts —
is frozen into the recorded Definition.

That makes four classes of problem possible:

| Problem | What the runtime does | What this pass does |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| A boundary scalar is *derived* inside the region | Explicitly extracting a value loses its parameter origin and freezes it into the recording; implicit conversion is rejected | **Step A** — hoists the computation to the call site, or leaves it alone when the frozen value is provably the right one |
| A view of a boundary tensor is taken *inside* the region | Freezes the first call's offset and patches only the address, so a later call reads call one's window | **Step B** — hoists the view to the call site, or accepts it when its window is replay-invariant |
| The region allocates its own intermediates | Records them correctly, on a heap it never reclaims mid-run, so the live set grows with the number of submissions | **Step C** — hoists the allocation to the call site as an `InOut` boundary tensor |
| The boundary itself is not cacheable | Declines to cache and silently runs the region as ordinary tasks | **Step D** — rejects it at compile time |

The first two can produce wrong answers when values lose their replay linkage.
The third produces correct answers that run out of memory, or merely slower, as
the layer count grows. The last produces
correct answers with none of the intended speedup — invisible to any numerical
test, which is why the checks live here rather than being left to a runtime log
line.

## Step A — derived boundary scalars

A boundary scalar carries its **parameter origin** in the runtime's
`InheritableScalar` wrapper. `args.scalar(k)` returns that wrapper; forwarding
it through `add_scalar` preserves the parameter index that replay refreshes.
Explicitly extracting a value with `to<T>()` loses that origin; implicit integer
conversion and arithmetic on the wrapper are rejected. Step A moves derived
computations outside the Graph body:

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Graph)
def layer(self, cur, wq, layer_idx: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX]):
    base = layer_idx * 5120          # <- derived: no argument slot
    ...                              #    frozen at the first call's value
```

Step A rewrites this so the value arrives as a parameter instead:

```python
# after the pass, conceptually:
def layer(self, cur, wq, layer_idx, base):   # base is now a real boundary scalar
    ...

# and at each call site:
self.layer(cur, wq_view(i), i, i * 5120)     # the arithmetic moved out here
```

A value is hoistable when its whole expression tree bottoms out in the Graph's
own scalar parameters and constants — exactly the set a call site can recompute,
since it already supplies those parameters. Scalar arithmetic in PyPTO is a
`BinaryExpr` / `UnaryExpr` node rather than a `Call`, so the check recurses
through those two base classes and treats everything else as a leaf.

New parameters are **appended**, not prepended: `CoreTaskArgs` requires every
tensor argument to precede every scalar one.

### A bare rename is deleted, not accepted

`n = batch` computes nothing, so there is nothing to hoist — but leaving it alone
would generate `int64_t n = batch;`, which the runtime rejects because the
wrapper has no implicit integer conversion. Explicitly extracting its value
would compile, but lose the parameter origin:

```cpp
const auto batch = args.scalar(0);  // preserves the parameter origin
int64_t n = batch.to<int64_t>();    // explicitly reads the recording-time value
g0_params_t0.add_scalar(n);         // the task no longer inherits the parameter
```

Recording classifies a scalar by its retained parameter origin. The integer
copy no longer carries that origin, so it is recorded as static data and every
later replay reuses the first call's number. Copying the wrapper itself with
`auto` preserves its origin.

Step A therefore substitutes the name away and erases the binding, so the task
reads `add_scalar(batch)` — the parameter wrapper. Chains collapse to their root in one
pass (`a = p; b = a;` sends both readers to `p`), and an alias of a *hoisted*
value lands on that value's new parameter. A rename that somehow survives is
rejected rather than waved through, by both Step D and the verifier.

### Hoistable vs replay-invariant

Not being hoistable is not the same as being illegal. Hoistability answers *"can
the call site recompute this?"*; the runtime only needs *"is this the same on
every call?"*, which is strictly weaker. Freezing a value into the recording is a
wrong answer only when the value can **differ** between calls.

| Property | Question | Consequence |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| hoistable | can the call site recompute it? | Step A moves it out; it gets a real argument slot |
| replay-invariant | is it the same on every call? | it stays where it is, frozen — correctly |

`ReplayInvariantSet` (`utils/graph_replay_invariant.h`) draws the second line.
Three seeds, closed under scalar arithmetic and over names bound to an invariant
value:

| Seed | Why replay reproduces it |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| a literal | trivially |
| the induction variable of a **constant-trip** loop | recording walks the loop once and bakes each iteration's literal into that iteration's own node; constant bounds mean every later call walks the identical sequence |
| `tensor.dim` of a boundary tensor parameter, with a literal axis | `graph_boundary_matches` compares each boundary tensor's `ndims`, `shapes` and `strides` against the recorded `GraphBoundarySignature` and declines the cached graph on any mismatch, so a boundary shape cannot change within one recording |

**Scalar parameters are deliberately excluded from the invariant set.** The
runtime patches a boundary scalar's slot on every call — which is exactly what
makes one a legal *task argument* and an illegal *frozen view offset*.

This is what admits a tiled kernel at all. A slab offset `i * TILE` cannot be
hoisted: the value does not exist at the call site. Every projection, MLP and
attention loop in a decoder layer is indexed that way, so rejecting it excluded
the whole shape.

`DataType::TASK_ID` operands are skipped outright rather than classified. A task
id is never a boundary scalar — the recording captures dependency structure
itself, and `graph_boundary_matches` refuses any call carrying an explicit
dependency (`explicit_dep_count() != 0`), so an id produced outside the region
can never reach a replay. This matters because the scalar check runs over
*every* call's arguments, so `seeds[0] = seed` — an `array.update_element` into a
`pl.array` of `TASK_ID` — used to read as a task consuming a boundary scalar
while the same id written straight into `deps=[...]` was accepted.

A scalar that reaches a task and is neither hoistable, a boundary parameter, nor
replay-invariant — because it depends on a task output or a tensor read — is
rejected with a message naming the variable.

## Step B — derived slices of a boundary tensor

Replay patches a boundary tensor's **address**. A view taken *inside* the region
is re-derived from whatever the recording froze, so it must be taken at the call
site instead:

```python
wl = pl.tensor.slice(w, [128, 128], [layer_idx * 128, 0])   # inside the region
```

Step B moves that slice out and passes the result in as an additional boundary
tensor. Each slice site becomes its own parameter with its own fixed shape,
which is what the runtime's `BOUNDARY_VIEW` classification requires — it matches
on same-buffer plus offset, with the shape playing no part, so a view whose shape
varied between calls could not be classified at all.

The hoisted statements are emitted **scalars first, then tensors**, because a
slice's offset is typically a Step A scalar and the binding has to precede its
use. The *parameter* order is the reverse — tensors before scalars — which is
what `CoreTaskArgs` requires. A view of a region-local tensor stays put.

**A view of a hoisted view is hoisted too.** Once `wl` moves out it is a boundary
parameter, so `wr = slice(wl, ...)` is in exactly the position `wl` was. The body
is SSA in definition order, so one forward pass reaches the whole chain — a view
can only name a source defined before it. Leaving `wr` behind is silent:
`graph_rebind_tensor` patches the buffer address from `wl` but keeps the offset
recorded on the first call.

**Provenance crosses an in-place call.** `tmp = kernel(a, tmp)` rebinds the
buffer to a fresh SSA name, and a view of *that* name is still a view of a
boundary tensor. Tracking only bare `alias = var` assignments loses the root
there, and Step B then skips the view outright — no hoist and no check — so a
call-varying offset stays in the region with the first call's window frozen. The
rebind is followed through
[`ExplicitReturnedParamIndices`](29-normalize_return_order.md), the same
return-position -> parameter map orchestration codegen aliases a call result on,
so provenance and codegen cannot disagree about which buffer a result names.
This applies to a boundary *parameter* just as much as to a Step C allocation.

The argument that map points at is resolved with `CallerSuppliedArg`, which
splits the three regions of the `Submit::args_` contract in `ir/expr.h`. A
`Submit` legally omits a runtime-allocated `Out` tail, and its caller-supplied
prefix still maps positionally, so requiring full arity would silently drop
provenance for every such launch. A parameter in the runtime-allocated gap
correctly yields nothing: the runtime creates that buffer, so there is no
caller-side root to inherit.

**A hoisted view must have a compile-time-constant shape.** Replay copies a
view's `shapes` and `strides` straight from the recorded template and patches
only `buffer_addr` and `start_offset`, so an extent read from a boundary scalar
would apply the first call's shape to a later call's buffer. An extent that is
replay-invariant is accepted for the same reason it is elsewhere: it cannot
differ, so freezing it changes nothing.

**A view has three outcomes, not two.** Replay restores a `BOUNDARY_VIEW` as
`boundary.start_offset + packed_offset`, where `packed_offset` is the delta
recorded on the **first** call; only the address, size, owner and version are
patched. So the offset is frozen, and that is wrong exactly when it can move:

| Every non-source operand is | Outcome | Why |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --- |
| derivable | hoisted to the call site | the caller can rebuild the view |
| replay-invariant only | **left in place** | frozen == correct, and the call site has no name for it |
| neither, or a mix of the two | rejected | the frozen delta would be call one's |

The mixed case is the one that matters. `off = layer_idx + i * TILE` can neither
be hoisted (`i` does not exist at the call site) nor frozen (`layer_idx` is
patched per call), and it is what a tiled region produces if it indexes weights
by both. Anything built on top of a view left in place — a view of it, or an
alias — is held to the same rule rather than hoisted, since the call site has no
name for any of them either.

**A varying offset is fine, and that is not obvious.** Codegen clamps a runtime
view to `min(declared, source.shapes[i] - offset[i])`, so the *actual* shape is
offset-dependent even when the IR extent is constant. It does not reach replay
because a hoisted view is passed as its **own** boundary tensor rather than
re-derived in the region: `graph_tensor_from_boundary` tries `BOUNDARY_EXACT`
across all boundary tensors before any `BOUNDARY_VIEW`, and a node consuming the
view matches the view itself, so `graph_rebind_tensor` replaces the whole
`GraphTensor` — `shapes`, `strides` and `extent_elem` included. The frozen-shape
behaviour belongs to `BOUNDARY_VIEW`, which is the in-region case this step
hoists out. Requiring the offset to be provably in bounds would reject the
motivating case, a per-layer `layer_idx * 5120`.

## Step C — allocations inside the region

`pl.create_tensor` at the top level of the region is **hoisted to the call
site**, where it becomes an `InOut` boundary tensor:

```python
# Before
@pl.jit.graph
def layer(a: pl.Tensor, acc: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor]):
    tmp = pl.create_tensor([ROWS, COLS], pl.FP32)   # allocated per submission
    ...
    return acc

# After — the call site owns the buffer
def layer(a, acc, tmp: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor]): ...
tmp__graph_arg0 = pl.tensor.create([ROWS, COLS], pl.FP32)
acc = layer(a, acc, tmp__graph_arg0)
```

Recording it in place is *correct* — codegen lowers a create into a batched
`alloc_tensors` and the runtime records that as a kernel-less node, the same
shape `submit_dummy_task` records — but the buffer comes off the **graph heap**,
which `task_allocator.h` never reclaims mid-run ("The whole graph must fit at
once; nothing is reclaimed mid-run"). The live set then grows with the number of
submissions rather than staying flat: a decoder layer holding 14 intermediates
costs 14 × N over N recorded layers. Hoisting puts the buffer back on the
ordinary reclaimable heap and empties the region of allocation nodes.

simpler's hand-written `examples/a2a3/host_build_graph/qwen3_14b_decode` scene
does the same thing by hand, for the same stated reason — "This keeps the
temporary live set flat in layer count and fits the default ring configuration."

The parameter is `InOut`, never `In`: the region *writes* the buffer, and
declared `In` codegen would emit `add_input`, the launch would never register as
a writer, and a caller that hoisted the allocation out of its own loop would get
no ordering between successive launches over it. `Out` is not available — on a
Graph boundary it means the runtime allocates, which `rt_graph_args_cacheable`
refuses.

A hoisted allocation **is a boundary tensor**, so a view of it is held to the
Step B rule above rather than left alone. That is not optional bookkeeping: the
`GraphBoundaryLegalized` verifier treats every tensor parameter as a boundary
root, so a view left in place with a window that can move would make this pass
produce IR its own verifier rejects.

Two allocations are deliberately left where they are:

| Left in place | Why |
| ------------- | --- |
| `tensor.full` | Orchestration codegen has no lowering for it at the call site either, so hoisting would only move the failure. Step D rejects it outright |
| A create under a loop | It is a *fresh* buffer per iteration. Collapsing N buffers into one parameter would make iterations alias, and the cross-task edges that would have to re-serialise them were derived by [`AutoDeriveTaskDependencies`](43-auto_derive_task_dependencies.md), well upstream of here |

What recording cannot reproduce either way is a *shape* read from a boundary
scalar. The extent is copied into the node and the buffer's address derived from
it, and replay never re-runs the body, so a later call with a larger extent is
handed the first call's buffer — a wrong address layout rather than a fallback.
Step D rejects that, before Step C runs, so every allocation Step C hoists has a
compile-time-constant shape.

### Prerequisite: a Graph's returns name their parameters

Step B and Step C both *append* an `InOut` parameter, and that is what made
automating this hoist a rework rather than a wiring job. Orchestration codegen
maps a call result onto one of the callee's `Out`/`InOut` params through
`return_lineage::ExplicitReturnedParamIndices` — a pointer-identity read of the
callee's `ReturnStmt` — and falls back to "the single `Out`/`InOut` param" only
when that map yields nothing:

```cpp
// GenerateSingleReturnAlias, orchestration_codegen.cpp
INTERNAL_CHECK_SPAN(returned_idx.has_value() || out_indices.size() == 1, call->span_)
```

A Graph body is `c_1 = layer_incore_0(a, c); return c_1` once
`OutlineIncoreScopes` has run — a rebind, not the parameter — so a Graph has
always relied on that fallback, and the fallback stops existing at the second
`InOut` parameter.

[`NormalizeReturnOrder`](29-normalize_return_order.md) supplies what the hoists
need: it canonicalizes a Graph's tensor returns the way it already did for
kernels and wrappers (canonicalization only — no Graph return is *reordered*),
and `IRProperty::ReturnParamsExplicit` covers `Graph`, so the nineteen passes
between there and here cannot quietly undo it. That landed separately in
PR #2618, so this step depends on it rather than providing it — which is why
`_legalize_outlined` in the unit tests runs `NormalizeReturnOrder`: without it
the map is all-nullopt and the hoists silently do nothing.

## Step D — boundary legality

Scalar-only control flow that submits no tasks may still read boundary values,
for example `for i in pl.range(n)`. Codegen emits explicit typed reads such as
`n.to<int64_t>()` in value contexts, including loop bounds and scalar carry
initializers. Task argument forwarding keeps the `InheritableScalar` wrapper,
including for floating-point parameters, so replay retains the parameter origin.
The orchestration entry reads its scalar inputs with `orch_args.scalar<T>(i)`,
which decodes values directly in both supported runtimes.

| Check | Why |
| ----- | --- |
| The compilation targets `host_build_graph` | `GraphTaskArgs` and `rt_submit_graph` exist only in that runtime's orchestration API, and codegen emits them unconditionally, so a Graph built against the default `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` yields orchestration C++ that names undeclared symbols. Reported here, against the function the user wrote, rather than as a C++ error in generated code |
| At least one tensor parameter | A graph with an empty boundary has nothing to patch on replay; the runtime refuses to cache it |
| At most 128 tensor parameters | `GRAPH_MAX_TENSOR_ARGS` — the boundary is a fixed-size `GraphTaskArgs` |
| At most 64 scalar parameters | `GRAPH_MAX_SCALAR_ARGS`. Checked after Step A, which *adds* scalar parameters, so a signature that fit before hoisting can stop fitting after |
| No `Out` tensor parameter | `Out` means the runtime allocates the buffer; a recorded graph's boundary tensors must already exist so replay can patch their addresses |
| Scalar parameters are `In` | A boundary scalar is passed by value and replayed from the call site |
| Returns only its own parameters | `rt_submit_graph` yields a valid task id only on a cache *hit*, so nothing can depend on a graph call's result. `return c` for an `InOut` parameter is the in-place spelling and is fine; a computed value is not |
| Between 1 and 1024 launched tasks | `graph_execution_storage_layout` refuses a node count of zero as well as one over `GRAPH_MAX_NODES`. A launch in a loop counts once per iteration, not once per call site, and `system.task_dummy` counts too — it lowers to `rt_submit_dummy_task`, and `ExpandManualPhaseFence` inserts them automatically. Allocations record nodes too, counted as an *upper* bound so that passing this check means the runtime will accept the Graph. Codegen collects every eligible create in a statement list — an intervening launch does not close the batch — and packs them at most `kAllocTensorsArgs` (16) to an `alloc_tensors`. Two of its three ineligibility rules cannot fire here (a shape reading a local is already rejected as non-constant; an already-declared var cannot recur under SSA), so those creates are counted exactly. The third can — an injected GM pipe buffer leaves the shared batch when its `core_num` reads a body-local, which only the emitter's use-resolution knows — so each of those is charged its worst case of one node. The batch size and the GM-pipe predicate are shared with the emitter in `utils/alloc_batching.h` rather than restated here. Counted **after** the hoisting steps, unlike every other check in this table: Step C *removes* allocation nodes, so the pre-hoist body would reject a Graph that fits and disagree with the verifier, which re-derives the same count from the rewritten IR |
| No allocation under a runtime loop or branch | Each records a node, so a count that varies between calls is a topology that varies |
| Allocation shapes are compile-time constants | Recording copies the shape into the node and derives the buffer address from it; a shape reading a boundary scalar is frozen at the first call's value |
| No `tensor.full` in the region | Orchestration codegen has no lowering for it and rejects it as a misplaced tensor op |
| No launch under a runtime loop, `while` or `if` | The recording fixes the topology on the first call and replays it unchanged, so a launch count or branch that can differ between calls would silently replay call one's shape |
| No *call-varying* scalar computed inline at a task argument | Step A hoists *named* derived values; an expression written inline at the call has no name to hoist and no boundary slot, so it would be frozen at the first call's value. A replay-invariant expression is accepted — the freeze is harmless |
| No Graph calls a Graph | The runtime cannot record a graph from inside one it is already recording |
| Every parameter supplied at the call site | A `Submit` may normally pass a prefix and let the runtime allocate the tail `Out` params; a Graph has no such tail |
| No explicit dependencies on the launch | An explicit dependency edge makes the launch uncacheable, so the region would silently run as ordinary tasks |
| No dispatch predicate on the launch | A predicate on a graph launch is neither honoured nor rejected — the runtime silently zeroes it, so the region would run unconditionally |

## Position in the pipeline

Runs after the final `Simplify` and immediately before
[`MaterializeRuntimeScopes`](50-materialize_runtime_scopes.md).

That position is forced from both sides. `DeriveCallDirections` and
`AutoDeriveTaskDependencies` must already have run, so argument directions and
cross-task edges are known. `MaterializeRuntimeScopes` must not yet have run, so
no scope wrapper has been placed around the statements Step A moves.

## Pass properties

- **Requires**: `SplitIncoreOrch`, `CallDirectionsResolved`
- **Produces**: `GraphBoundaryLegalized`, `CallDirectionsResolved`

`CallDirectionsResolved` is re-declared because the pass rewrites call arguments
and their direction attrs; `MaterializeRuntimeScopes`, which runs next, requires
that property.

The `GraphBoundaryLegalized` verifier re-derives the topology, node count and
hoisting post-conditions independently, so a later pass that reintroduces a
rejected state is caught. It shares exactly one thing with this pass:
`ReplayInvariantSet`. That is not a decision this pass made and the verifier
rubber-stamps — it is a reading of the runtime's own contract, and two
hand-written copies of it could disagree, leaving the verifier rejecting IR the
pass had just produced.

## Not yet handled

Hoisting an allocation made **under a loop** — it is a fresh buffer per
iteration, so the call site would have to allocate an array of them rather than
one (see Step C). Hoisting one whose shape reads a boundary scalar, which Step D
rejects rather than rebuilding at the call site. And packing a boundary of more
than 128 tensors into a scratch arena.

Neither does anything hoist a call-site allocation out of the caller's own loop:
a create lands immediately before the launch, so each call still gets its own
buffer. The win is that the buffer now comes off the ordinary reclaimable heap
instead of the graph heap, which is independent of where the caller puts it.
