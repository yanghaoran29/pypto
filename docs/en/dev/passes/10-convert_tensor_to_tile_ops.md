# ConvertTensorToTileOps Pass

Converts tensor operations to tile operations in InCore functions and updates orchestration call sites.

## Overview

After `OutlineIncoreScopes` extracts InCore scopes into separate functions, those functions still operate on `TensorType` variables using `tensor.*` operations. This pass lowers them to `TileType` variables with `tile.*` operations that map directly to PTO-ISA instructions.

The pass also updates call sites in orchestration/opaque functions: for each new output parameter added to an InCore function, a `tensor.create` is inserted at the call site.

**Requirements**:

- Input IR must be in SSA form
- InCore scopes must be outlined (run `OutlineIncoreScopes` first)
- Statement structure must be normalized

**When to use**: Run after `OutlineClusterScopes` and before `OptimizeOrchTensors`.

## API

| C++ | Python | Level |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| `pass::ConvertTensorToTileOps()` | `passes.convert_tensor_to_tile_ops()` | Program-level |

**Python usage**:

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

convert_pass = passes.convert_tensor_to_tile_ops()
program_tiled = convert_pass(program)
```

## Algorithm

The pass operates in three program-level phases:

### Phase 1: Transform InCore Functions

For each `FunctionType::InCore` function:

1. **Pre-scan MatmulSlice patterns**: Collect `tensor.slice` results consumed by `tensor.matmul` / `tensor.matmul_acc`. These need a Mat `tile.load` (natural, plus a zero-copy `tile.transpose_view` when transposed) instead of the default `tile.load(Vec)`.

2. **Insert tile.load (entry loads)**: For each `TensorType` parameter directly consumed by a converted op, insert `tile.load(param, zeros, shape, shape, target_memory=Vec)` at function entry. Parameters only referenced by self-loading ops (`tensor.slice`, `tensor.matmul`, `tensor.read`, `tensor.write`, `tensor.assemble`) are skipped — they manage their own loads.

3. **Convert body via TensorToTileMutator**: Walk the function body and convert each `tensor.*` call to its `tile.*` equivalent using `OpConversionRegistry`. The mutator propagates type changes through control flow (IterArgs, ForStmt/WhileStmt return_vars, IfStmt return_vars).

4. **Insert tile.store (exit stores)**: For each return value converted from `TensorType` to `TileType`, add an `Out` parameter and insert `tile.store(tile, zeros, out_param)`. If the return value comes from a `tile.assemble` loop, the loop is rewritten to use `tile.store` directly (conversion-time assemble-loop rewrite; distinct from `OptimizeOrchTensors` Pattern 3 which handles cross-function optimization).

5. **Upgrade written param directions**: An alias-origin analysis (`AnalyzeCallAccess`) attributes every read/write back to the parameter it originates from, then upgrades each `In` param that is written to `Out` (write-only) or `InOut` (read and written). Which argument an operator writes is **not** decided here — it is read from that operator's registry declaration (`set_arg_effect`, see [Operators](../ir/05-operators.md#argument-effects)), so `tile.store`, `tile.mscatter`, `tensor.write`, `tensor.assemble`, `tensor.expand_clone`, the `pld.tile.*` / `pld.tensor.*` push and pull family, `pld.system.notify`, `system.syncall` and the composite collectives all reach the same analysis through one table. An argument declared `Write` is not counted as a read: a store landing on a sub-region never reads the untouched remainder. Kwarg-dependent effects resolve per call, so an atomic store or an `AtomicAdd` notify marks its destination read+write while the plain forms do not. Params the user already declared `Out` / `InOut` are left as-is.

   An operator that never declared its effects still counts as reading every argument. That default is now confined to operators the registry has nothing to say about — most of them functional — rather than being the fallback for a hand-maintained list that a new write operator silently escaped.

### GM Store Coherence Restriction

An InCore function may not combine a bulk store (`tensor.assemble`, lowered to
`tile.store`) with `tensor.write` on the same underlying GM tensor. The bulk
store uses MTE3 while the scalar store uses the D-cache path; barriers alone do
not guarantee cache-line coherence between those paths on A2/A3. The pass
therefore rejects the combination instead of emitting code that can silently
lose either the scalar overrides or neighbouring bulk-written bytes.

Before applying the restriction, the pass canonicalizes a simple constant
scalar-fill loop into `tensor.full` plus `tensor.assemble`, which then lowers to
`tile.full` plus `tile.store`. The loop must be sequential, zero-based, and
unit-stride; its body may contain one or more `tensor.write` operations and
nothing else. Each write must cover a contiguous region with one loop-invariant
constant value, and the flattened region must satisfy MTE3's 32-byte row
alignment. This keeps full-block fallback fills on the MTE3 path instead of
rejecting them as mixed stores. Dynamic values, non-canonicalizable partial
updates, unaligned regions, and strided scalar loops remain on the D-cache path.

The pass also stages a full-tensor `tensor.full` initialization followed only by
scalar updates to that tensor. The scalar updates are redirected to the local
tile, and one `tile.store` writes the completed value to GM at function exit.
This supports dynamic sparse-map construction without mixing MTE3 and D-cache
stores. The rewrite requires a zero-offset, full-shape initialization backed by
a private `tensor.full` result; partial initialization, aliases, additional DMA
stores, or other uses of the GM target remain rejected.

The check follows assignment aliases and loop/branch carries. It is deliberately
conservative: it rejects mixed store paths to one GM tensor even when source
offsets appear disjoint, because the compiler does not yet prove cache-line
separation across symbolic views and control flow. Mixed paths to distinct GM
tensors remain valid.

```python
# Rejected: a partial assignment becomes MTE3 TSTORE, then pl.write uses D-cache.
output[0:1, 0:16] = pl.full([1, 16], dtype=pl.INT32, value=-1)
for i in pl.range(4):
    pl.write(output, [0, i], pl.cast(i, pl.INT32))

# Supported: update the local on-chip value, then issue one GM store.
staged = pl.full([1, 32], dtype=pl.INT32, value=-1)
for i in pl.range(4):
    pl.write(staged, [0, i], pl.cast(i, pl.INT32))
output[0:1, 0:32] = staged
```

Using `tensor.write` for every element is also supported when a single bulk
store is not practical.

### Cache-Policy Declarations → `tile.load` `cache` Kwarg

This pass is where a declared GM cache policy stops being metadata and becomes
part of the access. [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](08-outline_incore_scopes.md) left the
declarations on the InCore function as the `cache_policy` attr —
`std::vector<std::pair<int32_t, int>>` (param index, `CachePolicy` as int).
Phase 1 turns those indices back into param `Var` identities once per function,
then adds `{"cache", <policy>}` to every `tile.load` whose source arg is a listed
param: the entry loads it synthesises, the consumer-driven Mat loads, the
input-space bridge loads, and any `tile.load` already in the body (user-written
or produced by an earlier pass). The attr is **erased** when the transformed
function is rebuilt — nothing downstream may see it, because its param indices go
stale the moment a later pass grows the param list.

Precedence is per access: an explicit `pl.load(..., cache=...)` kwarg already on
the load always wins over the scope declaration, in both directions, so
`cache=pl.CachePolicy.DEFAULT` opts one read back into the cache inside a
bypassing scope. From here the kwarg simply rides the op through the remaining
passes to codegen, the way `target_memory` does. See
[GM Cache-Access Policy](../language/05-cache-policy.md).

### Phase 2a: Propagate Added Outputs Through Spmd/Group Wrappers

`OutlineClusterScopes` produces Spmd/Group wrappers that are transparent 1:1
forwarders of their params to a single inner InCore call. When Phase 1 appends
`Out` params to that InCore callee, the wrapper must mirror the appended params
on its own signature and forward them through the inner call — otherwise
orchestration codegen's `BuildWrapperReorderedParams` invariant (every inner-call
`Var` arg resolves to a wrapper param) breaks.

For each `FunctionType::Spmd` / `FunctionType::Group` function:

1. `ForwardedCallFinder` locates the first call to a transformed InCore (one
   whose Phase 1 added at least one `Out` param).
2. If found, the wrapper signature is extended with matching `Out` params (same
   type as the InCore's appended params, reusing the `name_hint_`), and
   `WrapperForwardMutator` rewrites the inner call to append the new vars as
   forward args and adopt the callee's new return type. `tensor.create` is
   *not* synthesised in the wrapper — allocation remains the caller's
   responsibility.
3. If no forwarded transformed-InCore call is found, the wrapper is left
   unchanged.

### Phase 2b: Update Orchestration Call Sites

For each orchestration / opaque function that calls a transformed InCore
function or a wrapper that absorbed output params in Phase 2a:

1. Insert `tensor.create` for each added output parameter
2. Append created tensors as extra arguments to the call

InCore, Spmd, and Group functions are skipped from this phase — they were
already rewritten in Phase 1 / 2a.

## MatmulSlice Pattern

When `tensor.slice` feeds into `tensor.matmul` or `tensor.matmul_acc`, the slice must produce a Mat-space tile instead of a Vec-space tile. The pass pre-scans for this pattern and emits a natural Mat `tile.load`; a transposed operand (`a_trans` for LHS, `b_trans` for RHS) gets a zero-copy `tile.transpose_view` at the matmul site.

The demand is propagated **through** zero-copy metadata ops that declare `set_output_memory_inherit_input()` — `tensor.slice`, `tensor.view`, `tensor.reshape`, `tensor.reinterpret_view`, `tensor.set_validshape`. So an operand written as `pl.matmul(pl.set_validshape(a[:, :K], rows, K), b)` still loads straight to Mat. An op that aliases its input's storage but omits that declaration breaks the chain: the operand materializes in Vec and needs a `tile.move` to Mat, which is a vector→cube boundary that flips an otherwise pure-CUBE InCore scope to `MIXED` and makes [`ExpandMixedKernel`](22-expand_mixed_kernel.md) split it into an AIC/AIV pair.

## Transpose Lowering

`tensor.transpose` lowers to a plain 3-arg **`tile.transpose(input, axis1, axis2)`**. The PTO `pto.ttrans` instruction needs a scratch workspace tile (same shape/dtype as the source), but that scratch is a pure codegen detail — not a semantic operand. [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](13-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) is the **sole owner** of scratch materialization: it emits the codegen-ready 4-arg form (`tile.create` + `tile.transpose(..., tmp)`) for both 2D and per-page >2D transposes, still before the memory allocator runs (so the scratch gets a real UB address). Keeping scratch out of the high-level op means `tensor.transpose` and the DSL `pl.tile.transpose(tile, axis1, axis2)` stay 1:1 with the semantic operation.

```python
# Before
y = tensor.transpose(x, 0, 1)

# After (this pass)
y_tile = pl.tile.transpose(x_tile, 0, 1)   # 3-arg, no scratch

# After FlattenTileNdTo2D (scratch materialized there)
transpose_tmp = pl.tile.create(x.shape, x.dtype, target_memory=x.memory_space)
y_tile = pl.tile.transpose(x_tile, 0, 1, transpose_tmp)
```

## Scatter Update Lowering

`tensor.scatter_update` / `tile.scatter_update` (whole-row scatter, `dim=-2` only) lower to a per-element `tile.scatter` (`pto.tscatter`) plus a `tile.sel` preserve-blend. The hardware `pto.tscatter` writes per element using a flattened destination index (`dst.flat[idx[k, c]] = src[k, c]`) and treats its `dst` operand as **write-only** (unwritten slots are not preserved), so the pass reconstructs the "keep `input` on unwritten rows" semantics itself.

The whole-row update `input[index.flat[k], :] = src[k, :]` is expressed as a flat index:

```text
flat_idx[k, c] = index.flat[k] * d + c          # d = feature width (= src cols)
```

The flat-index arithmetic is built **entirely in i32**, and only the finished row-major `[n, d]` index is narrowed to the `pto.tscatter`-required width (i16 for 2-byte data, i32 for 4-byte) via a single trailing `tile.cast`. Computing in i32 keeps every intermediate tile in a canonical, 32-byte-aligned, row-major layout — narrowing earlier would either cast a `col_major [n, 1]` view (which `tile.cast` mis-orders) or produce an unaligned 2-byte `[b, s]` tile (`cols * 2` bytes is not 32-byte aligned).

Generated PTO op sequence (FP32 `[32, 32]` input, `[2, 8]` index, `[16, 32]` src):

| # | PTO op | Produces |
| - | ------ | -------- |
| 1–3 | `pto.tload` ×3 | `input_tile`, `index_tile`, `src_tile` |
| 4 | `pto.tci` | column arange `[1, d]` = `0..d-1` |
| 5 | `pto.texpands` | zero template `[n, d]` |
| 6 | `pto.tcolexpand` | `col_nd[k, c] = c` |
| 7 | `pto.tmuls` | `row_base[k] = index.flat[k] * d` (index reshaped to `[n, 1]`) |
| 8 | `pto.trowexpandadd` | `flat_idx = col_nd + row_base` → `[n, d]` |
| 8a | `pto.tcvt` | narrow `flat_idx` i32→i16 (**2-byte dtypes only**) |
| 9 | `pto.texpands` | zeroed scatter base `[m, d]` |
| 10 | `pto.tscatter` | `scattered` = src into zeroed base (written = src, unwritten = 0) |
| 11–12 | `pto.texpands` ×2 | mask zero base `[m, d]`, ones src `[n, d]` |
| 13 | `pto.tscatter` | `mask` = ones into zeroed base (written = 1, unwritten = 0) |
| 14 | `pto.tcmps` | `pred = (mask != 0)` |
| 15 | `pto.tsel` | `out = sel(pred, scattered, input_tile)` |
| 16 | `pto.tstore` | write `out` to the output tensor |

`tile.sel` (not `input * mask`) reconstructs the preserve blend so the lowering emits no `pto.tmul`, which A2/A3 reject for bf16/i8. The index `reshape [b, s] → [n, 1]` is a buffer-view realias, not a separate PTO op.

## Paged Gather Lowering

`tensor.paged_gather(src, indices, block_table, ...)` gathers scattered rows of a paged KV pool directly into an on-chip buffer (L1 / `Mem.Mat` by default, or UB / `Mem.Vec`). The hardware `pto.tgather` instruction can only write UB, so paged-gather-to-L1 is **not** an indexed gather instruction — it is a fully-scalar per-row `GM → on-chip` DMA loop on the **Cube core (AIC)**. `src`, `indices`, and `block_table` are kept as GM tensors (the op is registered self-loading, so the framework does not preload them into Vec tiles).

The pass materializes the loop directly:

```text
rows = tensor.dim(indices, last_axis)                  # runtime gathered-row count
acc  = tile.create([max_indices, size], target_memory=space)   # static on-chip buffer
for i in [0, rows):                                    # ForStmt, iter_arg = acc
    idx   = tensor.read(indices, [i])                  # scalar GM read (pto.load_scalar)
    phys  = block_table[idx // block_size] * block_size + idx % block_size   # scalar
    acc   = tile.gather_row(acc, src, [i, 0], [phys, col_off], [1, size])    # GM->on-chip
    yield acc
```

`tile.gather_row` is a DPS op that writes one physical GM row straight into a
sub-region of the accumulator: `pto.subview` of `acc` + `pto.partition_view` of
`src` + `pto.tload` (`GM → on-chip`) — **no `pto.tmov`**. An L1→L1 `tmov` is
unsupported on a2a3 (L1 can only be filled via `GM → L1` `tload`), so the row is
loaded straight into the accumulator's sub-region rather than assembled.

Only the small index / page-table metadata is scalar-read from GM; the bulk KV data goes straight `GM → L1` via `pto.tload` and never touches UB — eliminating the GM round-trip that a `gather_kv → qk_pv` pipeline pays today. `is_trans=True` (Mat only) loads each row transposed into column offset `[0, i]`, giving the matmul B-operand layout. `max_indices` sizes the L1 buffer statically; the runtime `rows` count drives the loop bound, so dynamic gather counts are supported.

**Boxed (NZ) sub-region alignment.** An L1 (`Mem.Mat`) accumulator carries the matmul-operand NZ fractal layout, where `pto.subview` sizes must be whole multiples of the inner box (`M0 = 16` rows; `C0 = fractal_bytes / dtype_bytes / 16` cols). A per-row gather writes a single row, so `tile.gather_row` codegen emits a **box-aligned physical size** (`phys_rows = round_up(1, 16)`, `phys_cols = round_up(size, C0)`) while marking only the real extent valid (`valid = [1, size]`); the `tload` then fills just that row. UB (`Mem.Vec`, `slayout = none_box`) tiles have no inner box and use the exact `[1, size]` size. The gathered L1 tile is consumed by `tensor.matmul` directly (its natural use as a matmul operand).

### Kernel-Driven Gather (`tensor.create_l1` + `tensor.gather_row`)

`tensor.paged_gather` hardcodes its per-row source address (`block_table[idx // bs] * bs + idx % bs`). When the kernel needs arbitrary gather logic — multi-source selection, invalid-row clamping, overlay pools — it builds the same L1 accumulator itself from two tensor-level primitives, the flexible counterpart of `paged_gather`:

| Op | Lowers to | Role |
| -- | --------- | ---- |
| `tensor.create_l1(shape, dtype, transpose=...)` | `tile.create(target_memory=Mat, transpose=...)` | seed the loop-carried L1 accumulator |
| `tensor.gather_row(acc, src, dst_off, src_off, shapes, valid_shape=..., transpose=...)` | `tile.gather_row` (DPS) | DMA one **caller-addressed** GM row into `acc` |

Both deduce a `TensorType`, so the gathered result composes with tensor-level `tensor.matmul` / softmax; both are registered self-loading (`src` stays GM). The caller computes `src_off` and the `dst_off` slot, then fills the accumulator row by row in its own loop.

**Dynamic transfer length (`valid_shape`).** `shapes` must stay compile-time constant: it becomes `pto.subview`'s `sizes`, which the PTO dialect types as a static `I64ArrayAttr` (`SubViewOp` in `PTOOps.td`). The optional `valid_shape` carries the *runtime* extent instead — it feeds the subview's `valid_row` / `valid_col`, declared `Optional<Index>` SSA operands, and the GM `pto.partition_view` sizes, which accept a dynamic `?` dim. So a dynamic row count changes neither the allocation nor the box alignment below: the sub-region stays statically `shapes`-sized and only the copy length varies. Omitting `valid_shape` transfers the whole window, which is the pre-existing behaviour.

This turns a run of consecutive rows whose length is only known at runtime into one call instead of a guarded per-row loop:

```python
kv = pl.create_l1([128, HEAD_DIM], pl.BF16)
# r1 is a runtime Scalar[INDEX] — e.g. a page-boundary split point
kv = pl.gather_row(kv, pool, [0, 0],  [b0, 0], [128, HEAD_DIM], valid_shape=[r1, HEAD_DIM])
kv = pl.gather_row(kv, pool, [r1, 0], [b1, 0], [128, HEAD_DIM], valid_shape=[128 - r1, HEAD_DIM])
oi = pl.matmul(q, kv, b_trans=True)
```

**Bounds are on the written region, not the window.** `shapes` sizes the static `pto.subview`, so with a runtime `dst_offset` the declared window may reach past the destination — in the example above run 2 declares rows `[r1, r1 + 128)` on a 128-row tile. That is sound only because the transfer is bounded by `valid_shape`, not by `shapes`: the rows actually written are `[r1, r1 + (128 - r1))`, which stay inside. The caller's obligation is therefore `dst_offset + valid_shape <= dst.shape` per dimension; `dst_offset + shapes` need not fit. The two-run form above is covered on device by `test_gather_row_two_run_split`.

`valid_shape` is keyword-only in the DSL — `transpose` already owned the sixth positional slot, and taking it would silently reinterpret an existing `gather_row(..., shapes, True)` call. At the IR level it is a positional operand rather than an attr precisely because it may be a runtime value: it has to stay in the use-def chain so SSA/liveness keep the scalar alive. It is rejected together with `transpose=True` (see below) — that path would need a runtime *column* extent on a boxed NZ tile, which is unverified on device. The deducer rejects any *provable* violation of `0 <= valid_shape[i] <= shapes[i]`; a symbolic extent it cannot decide is accepted, which is the case the operand exists for.

**Transpose (ZN) for a `b_trans` matmul operand.** `transpose=True` makes the gathered tile a transposed matmul B-operand without a GM round-trip:

- `tensor.create_l1(..., transpose=True)` allocates the **transposed Mat (ZN) fractal** (`blayout = row_major`, `slayout = col_major`) — the layout a `b_trans` operand carries.
- `tensor.gather_row(..., transpose=True)` places the GM row `[r, c]` as the L1 column `[c, r]`. `pto.tload` does not transpose, so codegen presents `src` as a **DN-strided view** (`pto.make_tensor_view ... {layout = #pto.layout<dn>}`, shape/strides swapped, same base ptr) and partitions the row as a column — the `tload` then runs `DN → NZ`, which *is* the transpose. (`paged_gather`'s `is_trans=True` shares this `tile.gather_row` path.) A straight `ND → NZ` `tload` would scramble the fractal layout.

## AIV-Split Boundary Lowering (`tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather`)

`tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather` are the **`@pl.jit` / `pl.spmd` author-facing** form of the cube↔vector AIV-split boundary. They are emitted by `pl.aiv_shard(x)` / `pl.aic_gather(x)` when the operand `x` is a high-level **Tensor** (e.g. a `pl.matmul` result), inside a `for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(...)` region:

```python
raw = pl.matmul(q, k, b_trans=True, out_dtype=pl.FP32)   # Tensor, OUTSIDE the region
for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
    h = pl.aiv_shard(raw)     # C->V: tensor.aiv_shard — full [M, N] -> lane half [M/2, N]
    s = pl.softmax(h)         # AIV vector work on the half
    full = pl.aic_gather(s)   # V->C: tensor.aic_gather — halves -> full [M, N]
oi = pl.matmul(full, v, out_dtype=pl.FP32)               # Tensor, OUTSIDE the region
```

This pass lowers each **1:1** to its tile op (`tensor.aiv_shard` → `tile.aiv_shard`, `tensor.aic_gather` → `tile.aic_gather`), so from here on the IR is byte-identical to what the AUTO `pl.split` path produces via [`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](21-lower_auto_vector_split.md) (pass 20). `ExpandMixedKernel` (pass 21) then folds both into the cross-core `tpush`/`tpop` machinery.

**Constraints** (enforced by the tensor-level deducer and the DSL parser, not this pass):

- **2D-only** — `UP_DOWN` / `LEFT_RIGHT` are only well-defined on the 2D physical tile view; an N-D operand is rejected with a `pl.reshape`-to-2D hint (an N-D tensor would flatten to `[product(leading), last]`, so a pre-flatten row split would not match the contiguous half the lowering physically takes).
- **Region-only** — the `tensor.*` form is reachable solely through the `pl.split_aiv` region (which supplies the split mode). The outlined low-level `pl.tile.aiv_shard(t, split=N)` form stays tile-only; a Tensor operand there is rejected.
- **Distributed rejected** — a `DistributedTensorType` operand is out of scope (AIV/AIC split only) and is rejected upstream.

**Conversion details:**

- **Split-kwarg forwarding.** The `split` int attr (`1` = `UP_DOWN`/axis0, `2` = `LEFT_RIGHT`/axis1, the tpush/tpop encoding) is passed through verbatim to the tile op, which halves (shard) or doubles (gather) the split-axis extent.
- **Boundary memory.** The tile-level split deducer intentionally leaves the boundary memory space null (the deduction fixpoint must not inherit an input-side layout); `OpRegistry::Create` then fills it from the tile op's `set_output_memory` declaration, so this converter needs no re-attachment of its own. `LowerAutoVectorSplit` builds its `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` through the same `Create`, which is what keeps the two paths byte-identical — one declaration, read once. That space is the **consuming lane's**: `tile.aiv_shard` → `Vec` (AIV pops the half into UB), `tile.aic_gather` → `Mat` (AIC pops the full tile into L1, the space `ExpandMixedKernel` builds its V→C tpop in). The operand side is the mirror — `Acc` for the shard, `Vec` for the gather — and is enforced by the `AivSplitValid` verifier rather than declared as an input constraint, because a violated input constraint would make `InferTileMemorySpace` *insert a move* to the required space instead of reporting the authoring error.
- **No synthesized load.** The realistic (region-only) operand is already an on-chip tile by the time the converter runs (its producer — a cube matmul for `aiv_shard`, a Vec vector op for `aic_gather` — lowered earlier in this same pass), so no `tile.load` is injected; `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` **are** the cross-core transfer.

**Recognized before this pass.** Because the `tensor.*` form survives from `OutlineIncoreScopes` until this pass runs, earlier stages already treat it as the AIV-split boundary: `ClassifyCallAffinity` rolls both `tensor.*` and `tile.*` shard/gather up as `MIXED` (so cube/vector outlining splits correctly), and `SplitAivStructuralVerifier` requires both forms to be region-scoped.

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        ret0_out: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.tensor.create((64,), dtype=pl.FP32)
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = self.main_incore_0(x, ret0_out)
        return y
```

Key changes:

- `pl.add(x, x)` → `pl.tile.add(x_tile, x_tile)` (op conversion)
- `tile.load` inserted at entry, `tile.store` at exit
- `Out` parameter `ret0_out` added to InCore function
- `tensor.create` inserted at orchestration call site

## Loop-Carry Valid-Shape Repair

`tensor.matmul` drops its operands' `valid_shape`, so an accumulator only becomes narrower
than the seed it is carried from once this pass produces a `tile.matmul` over a
row-narrowed left operand:

```python
acc = pl.create_tensor([M, N], dtype=pl.INT32)          # full box
for k0 in pl.pipeline(0, K, K_TILE, stage=2):
    xk = pl.slice(x, [M, K_TILE], [m0, k0], valid_shape=[v, K_TILE])   # runtime v
    acc = pl.matmul_acc(acc, xk, wk, b_trans=True)      # narrowed, compact result
```

The carry is typed from its **init value alone** — `ConvertToSSA` mints the `IterArg` from
the seed, this pass re-mints it from the converted seed, and both force the loop's
`return_var` back to that type — so the narrowing dies at the loop boundary. `mad` writes
L0C at an N-fractal stride of `ceil(v/16)*16` while a reader that believes the full box
height walks it at the physical row pitch, corrupting every N-fractal above the first
(issue #2470).

Before returning, this pass therefore calls `narrow_loop_carry::NarrowAccCarries` on each
function: an Acc carry seeded by `tile.create` is re-declared at the extent its yields
prove — `tile.create(compact=True)` plus `tile.set_validshape` — and the body's def-use
closure is re-typed through the operators' own deducers. Repairing it in the pass that
creates it keeps the pipeline verifiable; leaving it would publish a carry the `TypeCheck`
diagnostic and the `AccCompactValid` property verifier reject. `FlattenTileNdTo2D` calls
the same helper, for an ND seed whose narrowing only appears when `tile.batch_matmul` is
unrolled into 2D matmuls.

A carry is left exactly as it is when the two readings of its buffer cannot disagree — a
single-fractal-block `[16, N]` accumulator packs to its physical rows whatever its valid
rows — or when the narrowed extent is only computed inside the loop body, where the
re-declared seed could not name it.

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/convert_tensor_to_tile_ops_pass.cpp`

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_convert_tensor_to_tile_ops.py`, `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_narrow_loop_carry_valid_shape.py` (the carry repair)

## Pass Properties

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Required | SSAForm, SplitIncoreOrch, NormalizedStmtStructure |
| Produced | SSAForm, IncoreTileOps, NormalizedStmtStructure, AivSplitValid |
| Invalidated | AivSplitValid |

`AivSplitValid` is both invalidated and re-produced, which forces a second verification of the split regions here. `OutlineIncoreScopes` establishes the property while the AIV-split boundary is still `tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather`; a TensorType carries no memory space, so the verifier's boundary memory-contract check is necessarily skipped there. This pass rewrites those ops to their tile form and attaches the declared boundary memory, which is exactly what that check inspects.

## Key Components

| Component | Role |
| --------- | ---- |
| `TensorArgsInConvertedOpsCollector` | IRVisitor — identifies tensor params needing entry loads |
| `MatmulSlicePatternCollector` | IRVisitor — finds slice→matmul patterns for Mat-space loads |
| `TypePropagatingMutator` | Base IRMutator — propagates type changes through control flow |
| `TensorToTileMutator` | IRMutator — converts tensor ops to tile ops via OpConversionRegistry |
| `ForwardedCallFinder` | IRVisitor — locates the wrapper's call into a transformed InCore (Phase 2a) |
| `WrapperForwardMutator` | IRMutator — appends new Out args to the wrapper's inner call (Phase 2a) |
| `CallSiteUpdateMutator` | IRMutator — inserts tensor.create at orchestration call sites (Phase 2b) |
| `IncoreTileOpsVerifier` | IRVisitor — verifies no TensorType ops remain in InCore functions |

## Scope

| Function type | Action |
| ------------- | ------ |
| InCore | Converted (tensor ops → tile ops); Phase 1 may append `Out` params |
| Spmd / Group (forwarding to a transformed InCore) | Signature mirrors the InCore's new `Out` params; inner call forwards them (Phase 2a) |
| Spmd / Group (no transformed-InCore forwarding) | Unchanged |
| Orchestration / Opaque | Call sites updated — `tensor.create` inserted for each new `Out` param (Phase 2b) |
