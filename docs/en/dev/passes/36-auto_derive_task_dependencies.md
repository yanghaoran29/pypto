# AutoDeriveTaskDependencies Pass

## Overview

`AutoDeriveTaskDependencies` derives conservative task-to-task dependency
edges inside AUTO runtime scopes when explicitly enabled. It runs after
[`DeriveCallDirections`](35-derive_call_directions.md), reads the resolved
`Call.attrs["arg_directions"]`, and writes compiler-owned producer TaskId
edges to `Call.attrs["compiler_manual_dep_edges"]`.

User-written `pl.submit(..., deps=[...])` edges remain in
`Call.attrs["manual_dep_edges"]`. The two attrs are intentionally separate so
IR dumps preserve provenance; orchestration codegen merges and deduplicates
them immediately before emitting `Arg::set_dependencies(...)`.

## Position in the pipeline

```text
... -> DeriveCallDirections
    -> AutoDeriveTaskDependencies
    -> ExpandManualPhaseFence
    -> CollectCommGroups
    -> Simplify (final)
```

User-written MANUAL regions are skipped: explicit `deps=[...]` are the user's
complete scheduling contract, and the pass does not add compiler deps or demote
the scope. AUTO regions are analyzed only when the compile-time
`analyze_auto_scopes_for_deps` switch is enabled. Hand-placed AUTO
`RuntimeScopeStmt` nodes keep `manual=false` in the output IR. For default
`auto_scope=True` orchestration functions, the pass runs before
`MaterializeRuntimeScopes`; when AUTO analysis is enabled, it uses an
analysis-only virtual AUTO region around the function body and does not insert
or move scope wrappers. Codegen still emits `PTO2_SCOPE()` from
`MaterializeRuntimeScopes`, and runtime OverlapMap/TensorMap tracking remains
enabled. Compiler-derived edges, when statically encodable, are emitted on top
through `Arg::set_dependencies(...)`.

## Algorithm

For each function body:

1. Build a conservative storage-location map for tensor Vars. Direct aliases,
   loop carries, tuple elements, `tensor.assemble`, and cross-function outputs
   inherit the same storage root and region when the root can be traced.
2. Preserve storage lineage through `IfStmt.return_vars` by merging finite
   branch root sets. Different branch roots are retained as alternatives, not
   dropped. Matching regions are preserved; differing regions for the same root
   widen to unknown.
3. Preserve loop and while return lineage by merging the initial carried value
   with the trailing body `pl.yield_()` value, then widening regions to unknown
   because the final iteration source is control-flow dependent.
4. Track constant rectangular `tensor.slice` windows as regions relative to the
   storage root only for bare tensors or packed ND `TensorView` tensors. Slices
   with symbolic shape/offset, strided views, non-ND layouts, `valid_shape`, or
   padding fall back to an unknown region and overlap conservatively.
5. Treat MemRef-backed shaped values as aliases when `MemRef::MayAlias` reports
   the same base allocation with overlapping or symbolic byte ranges.
6. Collect statically bound producer TaskIds from `pl.submit` tuple tails.
7. Walk each `RuntimeScopeStmt` in source order, maintaining prior accesses for
   that scope only. For default `auto_scope=True` orchestration functions with
   no materialized scope yet, use the whole function body as a virtual AUTO
   analysis region. For AUTO scopes this is analysis-only; the final scope mode
   remains AUTO.
8. For every non-builtin call with resolved `arg_directions`, classify tensor
   arguments as read, write, or read-write. Accesses to the same storage root,
   or to MemRef roots that may alias, are considered for region overlap.
9. Skip dependency edges for statically proven disjoint regions. Otherwise, add
   a compiler edge from any prior producer TaskId when RAW, WAR, or WAW hazards
   exist. Read-read pairs do not produce edges. User-written edges are respected
   and not duplicated.

If dependency-relevant tensor access cannot be represented as bounded static
roots plus fixed TaskId deps in an analyzed AUTO scope, the pass strips any
partial compiler-derived deps from the whole enclosing region and leaves it as
AUTO.
Implemented fallback triggers include:

- a required hazard whose prior producer TaskId was not statically bound;
- a prior producer inside a loop, where one scalar TaskId would not represent
  the runtime fan-in across all iterations;
- dynamic gather/scatter-like tensor values whose accessed region depends on
  runtime indices;
- root-set lineage that exceeds the pass cap for static alternatives;
- tensor arguments with read/write directions whose storage location cannot be
  resolved by the current lineage analysis.

This leaves the entire AUTO region on runtime OverlapMap/TensorMap tracking
instead of mixing partial compiler deps with runtime state at scope boundaries.
The fallback does not apply to user-written MANUAL scopes because this pass does
not analyze them.

## Default-Path Changes

- MANUAL scopes are not analyzed. User-written `deps=[...]` remain the only
  dependency source inside `pl.manual_scope()`, and the scope stays MANUAL.
- AUTO-scope analysis is opt-in. With the default switch value, AUTO runtime
  scope mode and TensorMap/OverlapMap tracking remain unchanged.
- Dead scalar assignment elimination preserves TaskId tuple-element extracts in
  all builds. This can leave a cheap scalar TaskId local that older pipelines
  might have removed, so dependency derivation/codegen can recover producer task
  ids.

## Properties

| Required | Produced | Invalidated |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `SplitIncoreOrch`, `CallDirectionsResolved` | `CallDirectionsResolved` | — |

The pass preserves `CallDirectionsResolved`: it rewrites only dependency attrs,
not call arguments or `arg_directions`.
