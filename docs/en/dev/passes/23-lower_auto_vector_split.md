# LowerAutoVectorSplit Pass

Converts an AUTO `pl.split` mixed `InCore` function into the **explicit
`split_aiv` form** *before* `ExpandMixedKernel`. It inserts `tile.aiv_shard`
at cube→vector boundaries and `tile.aic_gather` at vector→cube boundaries,
halves only the **vector sub-region** along the split axis, injects
`tile.get_subblock_idx()`, and stamps `split` + `split_aiv` on the function.

This is the **live auto-split lowering path**: it always runs, immediately
before `ExpandMixedKernel`. After it runs, every split function reaches
[`SplitVectorKernel`](26-split_vector_kernel.md) already `split_aiv`-marked,
so that pass only stamps attributes (its split_aiv arm) — its former per-op
halving driver was deleted, and the halving machinery now lives solely in
`split_axis_utils`, shared by this pass.

This pass lowers each first-class `SplitAivScopeStmt` region in place and
retains its wrapper. `ExpandMixedKernel` consumes that structure before codegen.

## Why this pass exists

A mixed `InCore` function written with `pl.split` describes cube and vector work
in one body, with the split intent expressed only by the function-level `split`
mode. Rather than halve the AIV body op-by-op *after* `ExpandMixedKernel` has
already split it (the old `SplitVectorKernel` path, which duplicated the boundary
semantics `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` already encode), this pass
rewrites the AUTO body into the same explicit `split_aiv` shape a hand-authored
kernel uses, *before* that split. `ExpandMixedKernel`'s single op-driven boundary
arm then folds shard/gather into split-stamped `tpush`/`tpop` for auto and
hand-written kernels alike — one downstream path. The result is byte-identical to
the old halving (proved during the staged convergence): both call the same
`split_axis::ProcessStmts` machinery, and only the entry point differs.

A load whose physical split axis has extent 1 is a replicated broadcast read: it stays unchanged, matching AUTO. It is not marked as a half-width value, so it cannot vouch for unrelated consumers.

## Pass Properties

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Required | `SSAForm`, `IncoreTileOps`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `TileOps2D`, `TileMemoryInferred`, `NormalizedStmtStructure`, `AivSplitValid` |
| Produced | `SSAForm`, `IncoreTileOps`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `TileOps2D`, `TileMemoryInferred`, `NormalizedStmtStructure`, `AivSplitLoweredValid` |
| Invalidated | `AivSplitValid` |

This pass replaces source `AivSplitValid` with `AivSplitLoweredValid`. The shared
verifier retains region checks while accepting the supported flat lowered form.

(`kLowerAutoVectorSplitProperties`).

## Scope

A function is rewritten iff **all** of:

- `func_type_ == FunctionType::InCore`, and
- it carries a function-level split mode (`UpDown` / `LeftRight`,
  `mode != None`), and
- it is **not already** `split_aiv` (hand-authored explicit kernels are left
  untouched — they already carry the explicit shard/gather form), and
- it is **genuinely mixed** (cube↔vector): its rolled-up affinity is `MIXED`,
  the same `ClassifyCallAffinity` / `CombineAffinity` decision `ExpandMixedKernel`
  uses for `is_mixed`.

Everything else is passed through unchanged. The last condition matters: a
**pure-vector** `pl.split` function (an elementwise op split across the two AIV
lanes, with no cube and no C↔V boundary) has nothing to converge, so it is left
untouched and `ExpandMixedKernel` converts it to a plain AIV function and strips
its `split` attr exactly as before. Were it lowered here, it would carry
`split_aiv` without a `split` mode after that strip, and `SplitVectorKernel` would
reject it.

**A mixed function whose body still carries a `ScopeStmt` is rejected**, on the
same rule as the region path below: whole-function halving does not cross a scope
boundary either. The rolled-up affinity is computed *through* the scope (a scope's
affinity is its body's), so the pass can tell a mixed scope-bodied function from a
pure-vector one and reject only the former — a pure-vector body is still passed
through, not failed. Normally unreachable, since the function-level `split` attr
this path keys on is written by `OutlineIncoreScopes`, which consumes the scope in
the same step; it is checked rather than assumed because the alternative failure
is silent. Before the check, `RollupAffinity` had no `ScopeStmt` arm at all, so any
scope-bodied function rolled up `SHARED`, read as not-mixed, and was passed through
**completely unsplit with no diagnostic**.

## Explicit `SplitAivScopeStmt` region path

In addition to the AUTO whole-function path above, an `InCore` function whose body
still carries one or more `SplitAivScopeStmt` regions takes a separate **region
path** (`LowerExplicitRegionFunction`), checked **before** the AUTO path. Each
region carries its own `split_` mode, so this handles the multi-mode case the
single function-level mode cannot. Region-local `tile_vars` / `var_replacements`
maps keep a halved var from leaking into a sibling region or an out-of-region op;
statements **outside** any region are emitted full-width. After all regions are
lowered, the wrappers remain and the function is stamped `split_aiv`.
`ExpandMixedKernel` consumes the regions and checks each region's transpose
hazard against its own mode.

### Shared body admission and AUTO regions

`AnalyzeSplitBody` checks both transformed AUTO bodies and explicit manual bodies.
AUTO supplies the tile facts established by its shape transformation before
substitution/cloning; manual bodies reconstruct shard and lane-address lineage,
including aliases, tuple projections and loop results. Broadcast reads and
read-only singleton arithmetic remain neutral, so accepting them cannot certify
an unrelated full-width consumer. Rank-1 loads and full reshape/reinterpret views
may stage a subsequent lane-local slice; they do not become half-width facts.

At control-flow merges, shard facts are intersected per tuple element across both branches. A loop backedge must preserve any shard fact inherited from its initial value. A neutral initial value may become lane-local in the body, but the carry and exit remain neutral; a zero-iteration exit cannot be classified using only its yield.

Admission diagnostics distinguish full-width operator names (`full_width_vec_ops`) from loop-carry names (`carry_mismatches`). A carry mismatch reports the lost entry shard fact and asks for a lane-local yield; an unlocalized operator reports its name and asks for lane-local operands or a localized read address. Explicit-boundary admission failures use user-facing `CHECK_SPAN` diagnostics. Failures after implicit or AUTO halving are compiler postcondition violations and use `INTERNAL_CHECK_SPAN` without authoring advice. Carry mismatches are reported first if both categories are present.

After lowering, AUTO wraps a single straight-line vector phase when the same
structural verifier accepts its region boundaries. It preserves compute order and the lane variable identity. The lane binding moves
into the region only when no outside statement uses it. Trailing SHARED calls
before the next compute phase or return belong to the vector phase. Interleaved cube/vector phases, control flow,
rebalanced `lane_stride` boundaries, and migrated boundary axes retain the flat
lowered form. Fallback retains halving, offset localization and boundary checks.

`AivSplitValid` validates source authoring before this pass. This pass produces
`AivSplitLoweredValid`, which accepts retained/synthesized regions and the flat
lowered fallback. `ExpandMixedKernel` requires and then invalidates that property.

### The out-of-region contract (manual mode)

"Emitted full-width" describes what this pass *does* with an out-of-region
statement, not what an author may *write* there. A function opening **at least
one** region enters **manual mode**: the regions own vector placement, and the
[`AivSplitValid`](99-verifier.md) verifier enforces that division well before
this pass runs:

| op / value | inside a region | outside every region |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| vector compute | AIV | **rejected** — check (e) |
| `tile.load` / `tile.store` | AIV | allowed (compiler-materialised) |
| cube compute | **rejected** — check (a) | AIC |
| `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` | the boundary | **rejected** — check (c) |
| `pld.system.notify` | pinned to AIV | duplicated onto both (**not** diagnosed) |

So outside a region this pass sees only cube work, the `tile.load` /
`tile.store` pairs `ConvertTensorToTileOps` hoists out, and core-agnostic
scalar / control-flow statements — never full-width vector compute, which must be
wrapped in `for _ in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):`. The multi-mode
goal is *regions only, one per vector phase*; a function with **no** region is
untouched. Checks (f)/(g) add that a tile crossing a region edge must name the
crossing, so no implicit cube↔vector crossing reaches this pass.

The last row is **documented, not enforced**, and region placement does not make a
region mean "exactly once": sharding a once-only side effect across the AIV
sub-lanes is the author's job, as is the lane rule for a `None`-region V→C
crossing ([Scopes and Placement](../../user/language/04-scopes.md)).

### Region placement consumed by ExpandMixedKernel

The region itself carries placement until `ExpandMixedKernel`. That pass erases
wrappers once per function and records eligible calls in a pass-local map over
the consumed body. No placement or validation attributes are serialized.

| intrinsic affinity | region effect |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| `SHARED`, no stated lane, `set_no_duplicate()` (`pld.system.notify`) | AIV only |
| duplicate-safe `SHARED` (`pld.system.wait`) | retains both lanes |
| `VECTOR` | already AIV |
| stated lane (`tile.create`, explicit `core_type`) | preserves declaration |
| `MIXED` boundary | keeps both transfer endpoints |
| `CUBE` compute | rejected inside a region |

This applies equally to synthesized AUTO regions and manual regions, including
pure-AIV functions. It does not make a side effect execute once across the two
AIV sublanes; lane-index dispatch remains the author's responsibility.

A function-level AUTO split and explicit `pl.split_aiv` regions are **mutually
exclusive**, enforced at [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](09-outline_incore_scopes.md)
while the scope's `split_` and its regions are both still visible; use
`optimizations=[pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)]` to size the pipe without
annotating a split.

Three region body shapes are handled, selected by the region's `split_` mode:

- **Data-parallel, full-width body** (`UpDown` / `LeftRight`, no explicit boundary
  op): the region body holds full-width vector compute. The region path injects a
  per-region `subblock_idx`, routes the vector ops through the shared
  `split_axis::ProcessStmts` halving machinery (region-scoped), and validates the
  per-region transpose hazard. This is the paradigm the auto-converged form
  produces.
- **Data-parallel, explicit boundary body** (`UpDown` / `LeftRight` with
  `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` already present): the user manually sharded
  the cube tile and wrote the vector compute on the per-lane half, so the body is
  **already** in half-width form. The region path detects this
  (`RegionBodyHasExplicitBoundary`) and **splices the body through unchanged**.
  Re-halving would double-shard — a downstream Acc→Vec move misread as a fresh
  cube→vector boundary and rewritten to a second `aiv_shard` — orphaning a halved
  Acc memref and crashing PTO codegen. `ExpandMixedKernel` folds the boundary into
  `tpush`/`tpop` as for a hand-authored split_aiv kernel.
- **Task-parallel body** (`None`): **no split axis** — both AIV lanes run the
  **full** body for disjoint work the author dispatches via `aiv_id`. The body is
  **spliced through unchanged** (no halving, no offset localization, no injected
  `subblock_idx`; the author's `aiv_id = get_subblock_idx()` already carries the
  lane). `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` are **accepted** here: with no split
  axis they cross the boundary without splitting, and `split=0` preserves the
  shape. `ValidateMixedExplicitRegion` is skipped — everything is full width. The
  function is still stamped `split_aiv`, so `SplitVectorKernel` dispatches it to
  **both** AIV lanes (`dual_aiv_dispatch`) rather than the lane-0-only replay;
  both therefore push on a V→C crossing, into one shared slot with no
  arbitration, so the cube receives an unspecified one of the two values unless
  the author keeps it lane-uniform. Use this mode when the tiles cannot be halved
  or a reduction must stay full width.

### What may appear inside an explicit-boundary region

Because that body is spliced through **unchanged**, every vector op in it must
already be per-lane — an op left at full width would run identically on both AIV
lanes. `ValidateMixedExplicitRegion` enforces this and rejects the region with an
actionable error naming the offending ops. A tile-producing op is accepted when
any of the following holds:

| Accepted | Why |
| -------- | --- |
| Consumes a `tile.aiv_shard` result defined in **this** region (transitively) | It is in the half-width dataflow by construction. |
| A pure generator — `tile.full` / `tile.ci` / `tile.random` (and `tile.create`, which classifies `SHARED` and so was never reportable anyway) | Its result is a function of its attributes only: it reads no tile and no memory, so per-lane replication is correct at whatever extent the author wrote. |
| An address-carrying op — `tile.load` / `tile.slice` / `tile.extract` / `tile.gather_row` — whose **read address** references the region's `aiv_id` | The author localized it explicitly, e.g. `data[base + aiv_id * HALF : ...]`. Only the read-offset args count (`tile.load` arg 1, `tile.slice` arg 2, `tile.extract` args 1–2, `tile.gather_row` arg 3 = `src_offset`) — a lane reference in a `shape`, a `valid_shape`, or a *destination* slot does not move the window, so it does not admit. |

The scan is seeded **per region** and makes one forward pass in program order, so
it recognises only a boundary result defined in the region it is scanning. A
`tile.aiv_shard` result reaching the region from elsewhere — produced in a sibling
region, or arriving through a loop `iter_arg` on the back edge — is invisible to
it, and the consumer would be reported as full width even though the value really
is per-lane. Both shapes are rejected 12 passes earlier by the `AivSplitValid`
verifier (checks (i) and (j), see [99-verifier.md](99-verifier.md)), which is what
keeps that false positive off the author's screen; this scan therefore only ever
meets a same-region dataflow, which is the domain it was written for.

`tile.gather_row` is the DMA case: being DPS it carries **two** offsets, and only
`src_offset` decides whether the lanes do different work — a lane-derived
`src_offset` means each lane pulls its own scattered GM rows (admitted), while a
lane-derived `dst_offset` over a lane-invariant `src_offset` means both lanes fetch
the *same* rows into different slots of a full-width accumulator (still reported).

Anything else that classifies `VECTOR` is reported. A generator is accepted for
**itself only** — `z = pl.full([FULL, N]); y = pl.add(z, z)` still rejects on `y`,
because a full-width generator must not vouch for its consumers. And the lane
reference is trusted **only** on an addressing op, so
`pl.set_validshape(full_width_tile, 1, aiv_id * HALF)` cannot launder a full tile
into the region.

The guard proves *intent*, not *extent*: a load at a lane-strided offset but a
full-width extent is accepted, and the two lanes then read overlapping windows —
the same trust already extended to `tile.store`, whose lane-dependent offset the
pass never checks.

Because the region is built via the generic `BeginScope`/`EndScope` and is
non-outlined, it can be **nested** inside a `pl.range` / `pl.pipeline` loop or an
`if`; the region path recurses into compound statements to lower every region while
preserving the surrounding control flow.

### Per-lane scattered gather

`pl.gather_row` is the only op that reads GM at an arbitrary **runtime** offset, so
it is how a paged/top-k row set is sharded across the two AIV lanes: each lane
assembles half the tile in UB and `pl.aic_gather` hands the reassembled tile to the
cube.

```python
with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, name_hint="sparse_kv",
           allow_early_resolve=True):                           # see the ring note below
    for aiv in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
        ub = pl.full([64, 512], dtype=pl.BF16, value=0.0)       # per-lane HALF extent
        for k in pl.range(64):
            src = pl.cast(pl.read(idx, [aiv * 64 + k]), pl.INDEX)
            ub = pl.gather_row(ub, pool, [k, 0], [src, 0], [1, 512])   # lane-derived src_offset
        kv = pl.aic_gather(ub)                                  # V2C -> [128, 512] in Mat
    out[0:16, 0:128] = pl.matmul(q, kv, b_trans=True, out_dtype=pl.FP32)
```

Two authoring rules make this work:

- **Write the accumulator at the half extent.** `pl.full` is a generator, accepted
  at whatever extent you give it and never joining the half-width dataflow on its
  own. The gather is admitted on its lane-derived `src_offset`, and the guard proves
  *intent*, not *extent* — so a full-extent accumulator would be gathered back to
  `2 x FULL` and mismatch downstream.
- **Watch the cross-core ring.** The V2C ring reserves `slot_size x slot_num` bytes
  of the consuming core's memory (L1 for V2C, UB for C2V), where `slot_size` is the
  **full** tile the consumer pops (`128 x 512 x 2 = 131072` here) and `slot_num`
  defaults to **2** — 256 KB of a 512 KB L1, which a kernel pushing once per
  invocation does not need to exceed. `pl.cross_core_slot(slot_num=N)` retunes it
  in either direction; grow it too far and `AllocateMemoryAddr` reports the
  overflow.

`pl.aiv_shard` is **not** an alternative to the half-extent `pl.full` here: it is
the C→V transfer and needs an `Acc` operand, so it cannot shard a value the
vector lane produced itself.

### Regions must be scope-free

Region lowering recurses into `ForStmt` / `WhileStmt` / `IfStmt` / `SeqStmts` but
deliberately **not** into a `ScopeStmt`: a scope carries outlining and
name-visibility semantics that region-local halving must not reach through. Every
region must therefore already be scope-free when this pass runs — normally
guaranteed by [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](09-outline_incore_scopes.md) (pass 9), which
lifts the enclosing `InCore` scope into its own function.

Pass 8 outlines scopes only out of `Opaque` / `Orchestration` functions, so a
scope standing inside a function declared `pl.FunctionType.InCore` reaches this
pass intact. The scope has to be **author-written** — the parser adds none of its
own there, emitting a top-level region bare so that a printed `*_incore_0`
reparses to the same IR, and authoring a region in such a function at all is
rejected earlier by [`AivSplitValid`](99-verifier.md) check (h):

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)   # pass 8 skips this function
def f(self, a: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
      c: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]:
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):                   # not outlined
        for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):
            base = aiv_id * 64
            c = pl.store(pl.exp(pl.load(a, [base, 0], [64, 128])), [base, 0], c)
    return c
```

After lowering, `LowerExplicitRegionFunction` re-scans the body and rejects any
region hidden behind a non-split scope with a `ValueError` pointing at the `pl.split_aiv` line. Drop
the redundant scope, or use plain `@pl.function` / `@pl.jit` (Opaque) so pass 8
outlines it.

The re-scan then rejects any **other** surviving `ScopeStmt` too, covering the
mirror case: a scope nested *inside* a region body. The split wrapper itself is allowed, so the first check passes — yet the inner walks (`LowerStmts`,
`CheckNoCubeTileHalved`, `AnalyzeSplitBody`) step over the scope rather than
entering it, and the vector ops inside would be spliced out full-width with both
AIV lanes computing the whole tile. Unreachable from the DSL (pass 8 lifts a
`with pl.at(...)` inside a region into its own function, and check (h) rejects
authoring a region in an InCore function the outliner did not produce), so it
guards IR that skips pass 8 — hand-built, or a deserialized `.pto`.

## Split-axis dispatch

| `SplitMode` (int) | Split axis | Vector sub-region halved on |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `None` (0) | — (no split axis) | nothing — task-parallel; tiles stay FULL, `aiv_id` dispatches both lanes |
| `UpDown` (1) | dim 0 (height) | rows |
| `LeftRight` (2) | dim 1 (width) | cols |

`SplitDimension(mode)` returns `0` for `UpDown`, `1` for `LeftRight`
(`split_axis_utils`); it is **not** called for `None` (the region path branches on
`None` first — there is no axis to derive).

### Split mode vs pto-isa split code

`SplitMode` names the axis the author picked. The `split` attr that reaches the
device names something narrower — pto-isa's `TileSplitAxis`, which also says how
the two lanes' **runtime** extents relate, because that is how the consumer finds
lane 1's band inside the FIFO slot (`popVecTileFromGMFiFo`):

| Code | pto-isa | Lane 1's band starts at | Requires |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| 0 | `TILE_NO_SPLIT` | — | single reader |
| 1 / 2 | `TILE_UP_DOWN` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT` | `e1 * pitch` | `e0 == e1` |
| 3 / 4 | `TILE_UP_DOWN_ODD` / `TILE_LEFT_RIGHT_ODD` | `(e1 + 1) * pitch` | `e0 == e1 + 1` |

The two vocabularies live on different ops:

- **`tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` carry the MODE** (`0` / `1` / `2`). This
  pass stamps `int(mode)` — the author's axis, nothing more.
- **`tile.tpush_*` / `tile.tpop_*` / `system.tfree_*` carry the CODE** (`0`..`4`),
  chosen by [ExpandMixedKernel](24-expand_mixed_kernel.md) from that mode plus the
  full-width tile's extents (`split_axis::ShardSplitCode`) when it folds the
  boundary into a transport pair. PTO codegen prints it verbatim as `{split = N}`.

An odd split axis reaches the odd codes in two ways, and the halving treats both
identically: `ComputeHalfDimSize` gives BOTH lanes the **ceil** half as their
physical box, and the per-lane valid extent carries the raggedness.

| Boundary tile | Lane boxes | Lane extents | Code |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---- |
| `[17, 128]`, fully valid | `[9, 128]` | 9 / 8 | 3 |
| `[16, 128]`, valid `[15, 128]` | `[8, 128]` | 8 / 7 | 3 |
| `[16, 128]`, fully valid | `[8, 128]` | 8 / 8 | 1 |

## Partially-valid operands across the boundary

A crossing value whose `valid_shape` is short of its physical box is a kernel's
ragged tail. The Cube→Vector FIFO pins the transported **column** extent to the
physical one and leaves the **row** extent free (derivation and ISA references:
[PTO codegen](../codegen/00-pto_codegen.md)). A narrowing on the *split axis* is
what makes an extent per-lane — lane `L` holds `clamp(V - L*half, 0, half)` — so
which mode is ragged decides which field has to carry it:

The table is the **shard's** (Cube→Vector) contract; `aic_gather` follows the
geometric rule at the end of this section instead.

| Ragged axis | Mode | Extent is | Carrier | Status |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| rows (split axis) | `UpDown` | per-lane | TPOP `valid_row` operand | **supported** when the lanes are placeable (below) |
| cols (non-split) | `UpDown` | shared, static | full-box transport + static `pto.treshape` | supported |
| rows (non-split) | `LeftRight` | shared, static | TPOP `valid_row` operand | supported |
| cols (split axis) | `LeftRight` | per-lane | none | **rejected** |
| cols, runtime-valued | either | shared, dynamic | none (`treshape` takes no operands) | **rejected** |
| rows, runtime-valued | `UpDown` | per-lane, dynamic | the boundary op's FULL box + the first consumer's `valid_shape` | supported (see the note below) |
| rows per-lane **and** cols narrowed | `UpDown` | both | none (`treshape` rewrites both axes) | **rejected** |

`ReshapeSplitAxis` can only ceil-halve the split-axis extent (the lane index is
not part of an op's type function). `LocalizeExplicitBoundaryValid` repairs that
guess here, where the region's `aiv_id` is in scope, and carries the per-lane
extent to consumers that pass `valid_shape` through; one that reshapes the
logical rectangle is rejected with its span. The AUTO arm applies the same *extent* repair through
`LocalizeShardValidForLane`, but not the store guard below — its consumers are
rebuilt by the halving walk rather than by this one.

- **The two lanes' extents must be placeable.** The split-axis extent is not a
  free field: pto-isa derives lane 1's band from the popped tile's own valid
  extent — `e1` cells in (`TILE_UP_DOWN`) or `e1 + 1` (the `_ODD` modes). So the
  placeable shapes are exactly `e0 == e1` (even code), `e0 == e1 + 1` (odd code)
  and `e1 == 0` (lane 1 pops nothing, so its band is never dereferenced — the
  even code stays exact). The box partition does not guarantee that for a ragged
  boundary — 13 of a 16-row box gives 8 and 5 — which is what the balanced
  partition below is for. When it does not apply, `ShardSplitCode` reports the
  extents instead, naming what would work.
- **A runtime split-axis valid extent pops the FULL box.** The split code is a
  compile-time attr, but which one the lanes need depends on their *runtime*
  extents: 12 of a 16-row axis leaves them at 8 and 4, 16 leaves them at 8 and 8.
  No code is right for both, so the boundary op does not carry a per-lane extent
  at all — `LocalizeExplicitBoundaryValid` gives it the full box
  (`split_axis::WithFullSplitAxisValid`) and moves the lane's extent onto the
  first consumer. That pairs exactly with the even code: the producer transports
  the full physical box, so lane 1's band sits at the box half and the even code
  points there, whatever the extent turns out to be. Confirmed on a2a3 for every
  extent 1..16 of a 16-row boundary. The [pto-isa
  pop](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pto-isa/issues/263) does place lane 1 at
  the popped tile's own extent, as its source reads — the earlier measurement
  that suggested otherwise came from a probe whose operands were uniform
  constants, which makes every row and column of the product identical and any
  band offset indistinguishable.
- **The same ROW extent on a hand-written `tile.tpop_from_aic` is still
  misplaced.** `SplitVectorKernel`'s halving localizes a declared `valid_shape`
  onto the pop itself, where pto-isa reads it as the band offset. Widening only
  the pop does not fix that path: its consumers inherit the author's declaration
  and then write partial destinations out of a full source, which measures worse
  on device. The xfailing params of
  `tests/st/runtime/cross_core/test_cross_core_split_parity.py` record the regime
  this affects: `half < V < box` on `UP_DOWN`.
- **A narrowed COLUMN extent is rejected on every path.** It has no carrier at
  all — the slot is written at the producer's physical column pitch while the pop
  rebuilds its geometry from the tile's own `validCol` — and on `LeftRight` it is
  the split axis, so it would have to be per-lane. `CheckSplitBoundaryCarriesValid`
  (`src/ir/op/tile_ops/cross_core.cpp`) owns that contract; it runs both in the
  boundary op's deduction and from `ShardSplitCode`, so a hand-written
  `tile.tpush_to_aiv` / `tile.tpop_from_aic` pair is held to it too.
- **An empty lane's store is guarded.** A lane the ragged extent does not reach
  has extent `0`, and a zero-row `TSTORE` is outside pto-isa's contract
  (`TSTORE_IMPL` asserts `GetValidRow() > 0`). The store gets a runtime
  `extent > 0` guard; `tpop` and `tfree` stay **unconditional** — both lanes
  occupy a slot and both must release it.
- **The gather is limited by geometry, not the DMA.** A V2C pop lands in an NZ
  Mat tile (`TLoadGm2L1Nd2nz`), which reads no valid extent at all. What limits
  `aic_gather` is placement: lane `l` sits at offset `l*half`, so the joined data
  `[0, v0) ∪ [half, half + v1)` is a rectangle only when the bands abut. That
  rule is enforced **in this pass**, not in the deducer, which runs before the
  per-lane extents exist and could only judge the join on its own ceil-div guess.
  A gather fed by a localized shard is typed exactly — the bands always abut, so
  the joined extent is the pre-shard `V` — and only a partial that both lanes
  share is rejected. The same geometry is why the gather has **no odd form**:
  `GatherSplitCode` always returns an even code and rejects a boundary whose
  lanes would differ (pad the axis and narrow the cube-side result instead).

## Balancing a ragged boundary across the lanes

The split partitions the split axis between the lanes: lane `L` owns
`[L*S, L*S + S)` of it. Two partitions are possible, and they differ only when
the boundary tile is ragged:

| Partition | `S` | Lane extents for a `[16, …]` box valid to 13 | Placeable? |
| --------- | --- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| box (default) | `ceil(box / 2)` = 8 | 8 and 5 | no |
| **valid** (rebalanced) | `ceil(V / 2)` = 7 | 7 and 6 | yes — `TILE_UP_DOWN_ODD` |

The box partition is universal: it works for every tile in the region whatever
its valid extent, which is why it is the default. What it cannot do is keep the
lanes within one cell of each other, and that is exactly what the transport
needs (see the placeability rule above). Balancing the VALID region instead
makes `e0 - e1 ∈ {0, 1}` by construction — and splits the real work evenly
rather than leaving lane 1 the remainder.

`split_axis::ResolveLaneStride` runs over the body before it is rewritten and
returns the balanced stride only when it is both needed and sound:

- at least one Cube→Vector boundary, all agreeing on the same static
  `(box, valid)` on the split axis, with `ceil(V / 2) < ceil(box / 2)`
  (otherwise the box partition already balances);
- no Vector→Cube boundary (the gather re-joins the lanes positionally at their
  own extents, which only abut when they are equal);
- every other split-axis tile in the body derives from that boundary — a tile
  with an independent origin (a `tile.load`, a generator) spans the FULL box,
  which the balanced partition would not cover.

Anything else keeps the box partition. The stride then threads through the whole
halving — offsets (`AdjustOffsets`), per-lane valid extents
(`LocalizeValidDimForSplit`), the shard's own type
(`LocalizeShardValidForLane`) — while the physical box stays `ceil(box / 2)`, so
buffers and slot sizes are unchanged. It is stamped on the boundary op as
`lane_stride=S` so [ExpandMixedKernel](24-expand_mixed_kernel.md) derives the
transport code from the same partition. A `tile.reshape` that migrates the split
axis inside a rebalanced body is rejected: a migrated axis carries its own half,
which cannot express a partition balanced on another axis.

```python
# 13 of 16 valid rows, UP_DOWN. Lane 0 takes rows 0-6, lane 1 rows 7-12.
popped: pl.Tile[[8, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec,
                pl.TileView(valid_shape=[pl.min(pl.max(13, aiv_id * 7) - aiv_id * 7, 7), 128])
               ] = pl.tile.aiv_shard(qk, split=1, lane_stride=7)
out_store = pl.tile.store(popped, [0 + aiv_id * 7, 0], out_0)
```

Explicit `pl.split_aiv` regions are never rebalanced: their per-lane offsets are
the author's own (`out[aiv_id * HALF : ...]`), and the compiler must not
partition the data differently from the way the region indexes it.

## Algorithm

`LowerFunction` rewrites one mixed `InCore` function:

```text
1. split_dim = SplitDimension(mode); the boundary op carries int(mode).
2. InjectSubblockIdx(func, is_aiv=true) prepends
       subblock_idx = tile.get_subblock_idx()
   to the body (fresh name if 'subblock_idx' is taken).
2a. ResolveLaneStride(body, split_dim) picks the partition: the balanced
    ceil(V / 2) for a body that is one ragged crossing, else null (the box
    partition). It threads through every offset / per-lane extent below.
3. LowerStmts walks the flat body:

   Boundary tile.move (ClassifyMoveDirection):
     CUBE_TO_VECTOR — replace the move with
         tile.aiv_shard(full_cube_tile, split=int(mode)[, lane_stride=S])  -> HALF
       The deduced HALF type already carries the consuming-lane memory
       (Vec): the split deducer leaves memory_space null and
       OpRegistry::Create fills it from tile.aiv_shard's set_output_memory
       declaration, shared with the explicit form. Seed it into tile_vars (its half
       extent) and record the old->new var rebind. The cube source (the
       matmul / Acc result) stays FULL.
     VECTOR_TO_CUBE — insert
         tile.aic_gather(half_vector_tile, split=int(mode))  -> FULL
       resolving the source to its halved var so the gather doubles
       HALF -> FULL, then keep the original cube-placement move on the
       gathered FULL tile (named "<dest>_mat" so ExpandMixedKernel's V->C
       boundary names its synthesized tpop after it).

   Affinity gate (ClassifyCallAffinity):
     VECTOR-affine leaf — route the single statement through
       split_axis::ProcessStmts({stmt}, ..., is_aiv=true): the SAME machinery
       the deleted SplitVectorKernel driver used. Halves tile.load /
       tile.store / tile.slice / tile.reshape / compute results on split_dim,
       localizes offsets per subblock, tracks halved vars in tile_vars.
     CUBE-affine leaf — passed through FULL, never halved.

   ForStmt / IfStmt — recurse into the body for vector content.

4. CheckNoCubeTileHalved re-walks the rebuilt body and asserts no CUBE-affine
   op consumes or produces a tile in tile_vars (the affinity gate must never
   leak a halved tile into a cube operand) — INTERNAL_CHECK on failure.
5. transform_utils::Substitute applies var_replacements; DeepClone detaches
   shared sub-trees.
6. WithSplitAivAttrs stamps split + split_aiv (dropping any prior split /
   split_aiv / dual_aiv_dispatch entries).
```

The per-op vector halving (shape halved on the split axis, offset localized by
`subblock_idx * half`, `tile.slice` static-shape-arg halving in lockstep with
the result type, rank-1-load reshape sliced per lane, reduce-on-split-axis
rejected, singleton split-dim preserved, loop `iter_arg`/`return_var`
tracking) is all produced by `split_axis::ProcessStmts` / `ProcessStmt` —
documented in detail in the shared machinery; the same facts are exercised by
`tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_lower_auto_vector_split.py`.

Automatic halving rejects the root generators `tile.ci` and `tile.random` when
their split dimension is non-singleton. Their generated values depend on
position, so changing only the result type is insufficient: a correct rewrite
also needs lane-specific shape and generator state, which this pass does not
synthesize. Move the operation outside the automatically-halved split region.
Singleton split dimensions and already-half-width explicit-boundary regions
remain unchanged.

Halving a result is sound only under **two conditions**, asked in this order
because the first subsumes the second wherever it can speak:

| # | Condition | Decided by | Catches |
| - | --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1 | the halved node still type-checks against its own arguments | the operator's own `f_deduce_type` — no metadata | a full-width `tile.add` operand, a rank-1 bias on the split axis, `row_argmax`'s shape-matched `tmp`, `tile.transpose_view`'s axis permutation |
| 2 | an operand condition 1 is **blind** to is lane-local, broadcast along the split axis, or **declared** lane-invariant | a registry declaration | `tile.sel`'s full-width `mask`, which its result deduction never reads |

### Condition 1 — the halved node still type-checks

After rewriting the arguments, the pass re-deduces the result from the arguments
the trailing `Substitute` will install (each tracked operand swapped for its
halved replacement) and compares the deduced *physical* shape against the halved
result type. Valid shape is excluded: `HalveTileShape` localizes it per lane,
which deduction cannot reproduce. A deduction that rejects the halved arguments
outright counts as a mismatch too — the operator is refusing the very node it
would receive.

This asks the operator itself, so it needs no per-operator metadata and cannot go
stale as operators are added or their contracts change. It is what rejects the
ordinary case:

```python
def split_auto(vec: pl.Tile[[256, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec], ...):
    vec_h = pl.tile.add(vec, vec)   # rejected: `vec` is full width
```

`vec` is a full-width `InCore` parameter, so nothing inside the region partitions
it. Halving only the result would emit
`tile.add([256, 128], [256, 128]) -> [128, 128]`, a node whose declared shape
contradicts type inference over its own arguments; it does not survive
print→parse and misleads every later consumer that re-derives types from
operands. Derive the per-lane half first (`tile.load` / `tile.slice` inside the
region, or an explicit `pl.tile.aiv_shard`), or keep a value both lanes share
outside the region.

The same check decides cases a shape heuristic gets wrong in both directions.
Operands align to the result **from the right**, matching `BroadcastShapes`:

| `tile.add([256, 128], bias)` | `UP_DOWN` (dim 0) | `LEFT_RIGHT` (dim 1) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `bias: [128]` | accepted — broadcasts over the split axis | rejected — `BroadcastShapes([256, 64], [128])` fails |
| `bias: [1, 128]` | accepted — singleton on the split axis | rejected — its dim 1 is full width |
| `bias: [256, 128]` | rejected | rejected |

and it covers an axis-permuting operator, which no right-alignment rule
describes:

```python
def split_auto(data: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec], ...):
    viewed = pl.tile.transpose_view(data)   # rejected: [128, 1] vs the [256, 1] deduced
```

`tile.transpose_view` swaps the trailing two dims, so the halved `[128, 1]`
result contradicts the `[256, 1]` its own operand deduces. Unlike
`tile.transpose`, this is a pure view and is outside `FindTransposeSplitHazard`,
which matches `tile.transpose` only.

The shape-describing ops (`tile.full`, `tile.create`, `tile.slice`,
`tile.reshape`, `tile.reinterpret_view`) rewrite their own operands before this
check runs, and each has a defined full-width-source meaning.

`tile.reshape` and `tile.reinterpret_view` get that from an earlier rewrite: an
offsetless view over an untracked source is emitted at full width and followed by
a per-subblock `tile.slice`, so each lane reads its own half instead of both
reading the first one. That slice can only be materialized from a **static** half
extent, so a dynamic split extent over a full-width source is rejected rather
than left to fall through to plain result halving.

### Condition 2 — operands type deduction is blind to

A deducer that never reads an operand's extent says nothing by accepting it. The
pass detects that per call, with no metadata: it re-deduces once more with the
operand **doubled** on the split axis. If deduction throws or the result changes,
the deducer *pins* that operand and condition 1 already decided it. If the answer
is unchanged, the operand is *blind*, and only a declaration can say whether full
width is in contract.

```python
picked = pl.tile.sel(mask, lhs, rhs, tmp)   # rejected when `mask` is full width
```

`tile.sel` deduces its result from `BroadcastShapes(lhs, rhs)` alone and checks
only that `mask` is a `TileType`, so a full-width mask over halved lhs/rhs
re-deduces perfectly cleanly — yet both lanes would read mask rows `0..127`.
`tile.sels` is the same shape of trap: it validates that the mask *covers* src's
valid rows, and an oversized mask satisfies coverage. Both declare only their
`tmp` position, so their masks are rejected. An operand nobody has classified is
treated as lane data, which is the safe default.

Restricting this to blind operands is what keeps it in its lane. Without it,
every operator with a legal full-width operand would need a registry declaration
purely to suppress a check that had no business running — which is how
`tile.rsqrt` came to declare a scratch its own deducer requires to match the
input exactly. `tests/ut/ir/operators/test_lane_invariant_arg_coverage.py`
measures which operands are blind, fails on a declaration the deducer makes
unreachable, and pins the blind set so a new operator or a loosened deducer has
to be classified rather than silently falling through.

**Blind is usually a symptom, and the deducer is usually the cure.** An operand
lands in the blind set when the deducer never reads its extent — which is often
just an under-validated contract rather than a genuinely free dimension. Then
the fix is to *enforce the relation the operator already documents*, not to
declare the operand lane-invariant: the check now rejects a mis-shaped operand
for every caller, and the split pass gets a pinned answer for free.
`tile.scatter_update`'s `index` and `src` were blind because deduction only
copied the input's type; enforcing what the tensor path's lowering already
asserts (`src` rows `== b * s`, matching widths) pinned both. A declaration
would have suppressed the split check *and* left the shape bug in place.

The test for a declaration is *positional correspondence*: does output element
`i` read operand element `i`? Two kinds of operand answer no.

**Hardware scratch.** A full-width workspace is in contract, and each lane simply
declares the whole thing:

```python
scratch = pl.tile.create([256, 128], dtype=pl.FP32, target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
sums = pl.tile.row_sum(v, scratch)      # accepted: [128, 128] x [256, 128] -> [128, 1]
```

`tile.row_sum` documents its `tmp_tile` as scratch *at least as large as* the
input, never reads it in `DeduceTileRowReductionType`, and declares it with
`set_lane_invariant_arg(1)`. `tile.create` is registered `CoreAffinity::SHARED`,
so [the affinity gate](#the-affinity-gate) deliberately passes it through full
width and never tracks it — matching on the extent alone would reject the whole
rms-norm reduction shape.

Its sibling `tile.row_argmax` needs a tmp shaped *exactly* like the source, and
`DeduceTileRowReductionType` enforces that with `require_exact_tmp_shape`. It
therefore carries **no** declaration: condition 1 rejects a full-width tmp on its
own, and a declaration would claim a contract the operator does not grant.

**An operand addressed at absolute indices.**

```python
indices = pl.tile.load(idx, [0, 0], [256, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
picked = pl.tile.gather(src, indices, tmp)   # accepted: src stays [256, 128]
```

`tile.gather` computes `out[i] = src[indices[i]]` and takes its result shape from
`indices`. The index values are absolute into `src`, so halving `indices` already
gives each lane its own half of the **output** while both read the whole table —
that is the correct lowering, not a missing shard. `tile.gatherb` is the
byte-offset form of the same shape. `tile.scatter` and `tile.scatter_update` are
the write-side dual, addressing a *destination* by absolute index.

**The declaration permits a full-width operand; it does not keep one.** Nothing
stops the operand's own producer from being halved, and the kinds differ on what
that means — which is why the registry records *which* kind applies:

| Kind | Full width | Producer partitioned | Example |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| `Scratch` | allowed | fine — a halved input takes a halved scratch with it | `row_sum`'s `tmp_tile` |
| `IndexAddressedSource` | allowed | **rejected** — indices stay absolute, so lane 1 reads the wrong half | `gather`'s `src` |
| `AbsoluteIndexedDestination` | allowed | **rejected** — the write side of the same defect | `scatter`'s `dst` |

`tile.scatter` writes `dst.flat[indexes[i, j]] = src[i, j]` with *flattened*
offsets into the whole destination, so a column write encoding `i * dst_cols + c`
stops matching the moment the row stride halves.

```python
src = pl.tile.load(tbl, [0, 0], [256, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
picked = pl.tile.gather(src, indices, tmp)   # rejected: the table was halved
```

This is the ordinary path rather than a corner: `pl.gather` over a tensor lowers
to a `tile.load` of the table feeding `tile.gather`, so an author who gathers
inside a split region hits it by default. Neither condition above sees it — the
operand is tracked, so condition 2 skips it, and `tile.gather` deduces its result
from `indices` alone, so condition 1 is satisfied. That is why the absolute-index
kinds stay declared even where the deducer *does* read the operand: the property
is not type-expressible in either direction. Produce the table **outside** the
split region and pass it in; keeping such a producer at full width automatically
is not implemented.

The absolute-index check runs **before** the halving path, not beside it, because
the trailing `Substitute` rewrites the argument even where nothing is halved:

- a **singleton result** returns early — `gather` with `[1, N]` indices yields a
  `[1, N]` result, so the result is untouched while the table under it is still
  halved;
- a **tuple result** takes its own path (below), because the generic block follows
  one `result_split_dim` and a tuple has one *per element*.

### Tuple results — one split axis per element

`tile.gather_compare` returns `Tuple[dst[rows, out_cols], cdst[1, rows]]`. Under a
row split those two elements do **not** move along the same axis: `dst` halves on
dim 0, while `cdst` — a single contiguous row of per-row counts — halves on dim 1.
There is no single result axis to follow, so the generic path cannot express it.

The mapping is **discovered, not declared**: re-deduce the call from the arguments the
halved node will carry, and read which axis of each element moved. A new tuple-returning
operator needs no registration, and the mapping cannot go stale the way per-operator
metadata did (gh#2612). Re-deduction supplies only the *axis*; `HalveTileShape` still
halves, so odd extents localize per lane as usual.

Every element must halve on exactly one axis. An element that comes back **unchanged**
is the dangerous case, not the harmless one — the operator produced a full-width output
from an operand each lane owns only half of, so neither lane holds the whole answer while
the shape still looks right. That is what correctly rejects a LEFT_RIGHT
`tile.gather_compare`: both its outputs are sized from the source's *rows*.

`split_axis::RetypeTupleProjection` retypes the `x = tup[i]` projections from the halved
tuple and records each element's own axis, so a later `tile.store` offsets the right
dimension. **Both** lowering arms call it — the AUTO arm's affinity gate only routes leaf
*calls* into `ProcessStmts`, so a projection left to its pass-through fallback would keep
a full-width declared type over a halved tuple.

A projection need not be bound at all: `pl.tile.store(pair[0], [0, 0], out)` passes the
`TupleGetItemExpr` **inline**, and nothing hoists it — so anything matching only `Var` on
a tile operand misses it, and the operand is still substituted afterwards, leaving a
full-width declared type over per-lane data. `split_axis::OperandSplitInfo` is the single
answer to "did the split partition this operand, and along which axis"; it handles a
bound `Var` and an inline projection alike, and `BuildHalvedCallArgs` rebuilds the
projection over the halved tuple so the type-consistency probe sees per-lane operands
too. Every consumer goes through them — the generic path's tracked-input scan,
`LocalizeStoreOffset`, and `GetFirstTileArgMemory` (which reads the operand's *type*, so
a vector op is no longer misclassified SHARED and replicated onto both lanes).

Everything that asks "was this operand partitioned" goes through `OperandSplitInfo`.
That question has more consumers than the halving itself, and each answered *no* for an
inline projection with a different consequence:

| Asks it | Wrong answer costs |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| the generic path's tracked-input scan | the result keeps a full-width type over per-lane operands |
| `LocalizeStoreOffset` | both lanes store to the same rows |
| `GetFirstTileArgMemory` | a vector op classifies SHARED and is replicated onto both lanes |
| absolute-index gate | a halved `tile.gather` table under absolute indices — **no diagnostic**, since `gather` sizes its result from `indices` |
| `tile.reshape` / `tile.reinterpret_view` | a full-width view plus a per-lane slice over an operand about to be halved |
| `tile.slice` offset | `+ subblock_idx * half` added to an already lane-local offset, so lane 1 reads past the end |
| the V→C boundary | a legal `tile.move(pair[0], target_memory=Mat)` refused as full width |
| `RepairIterArgs` (loop init) | the carry, the exit, and everything after the loop stay full width under a halved init |
| `YieldedTileInfo` (backedge / merge) | **both** ways: a full-width carry fed `pl.yield_(pair[1])` waved through, and a legally halved one refused |
| `FindFullWidthOperand` (condition 2) | a partitioned projection reported as a full-width operand — a false rejection |

The only `AsVarLike` lookups left in the pass are inside `OperandSplitInfo` /
`ReplacedOperand` themselves, and the two places that deliberately identify a **whole
tuple** by variable (`YieldedHalvedTupleType`, `RetypeTupleProjection`). Anything else
asking about an operand's split belongs in the helper — that is what stops this class
from recurring one call site at a time.

The boundary also builds its `tile.aic_gather` from `ReplacedOperand`, which rebuilds an
inline projection over the halved tuple so the gather doubles HALF → FULL either way.

A tuple also crosses **merges and loop carries**, and neither reads its split from
`tile_vars` — a tuple var is never in it. Both adopt the halved *type* instead, whose
elements already carry the per-element split, so there is no single axis to record:

| Shape | Repaired by | Agreement rule |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `if` merge | `RepairIfReturnVars` | both branches must yield the same halved tuple |
| loop carry + exit | `RepairIterArgs` / `RepairReturnVars` | the backedge `Yield` must match the carry |

The DSL cannot annotate either, but `ConvertToSSA` synthesizes exactly the merge phi for
a tuple reassigned in a branch, and `pl.range(..., init_values=(tup,))` carries one
directly.

Two different failures end in a rejection, and the diagnostics keep them apart — one
message cannot explain both:

| The operator... | Cause | Diagnostic |
| --------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| **refuses** the halved arguments | a constraint does not survive halving (`tile.tquant_mx` needs `M % 16 == 0`); or a workspace sized from the full source — after `LowerCompositeOps` decomposes it, `tile.tquant_mx_raw` needs its `[1, groups]` scratch to match a count derived from `src`, and that singleton dim 0 keeps the generic path from halving it. Repartitioning one is **not implemented**: the extent lives in the deducer, and the allocation was already emitted at full width | quote the operator rather than guess which |
| **accepts** them, but an element did not move | the wrong-contents case above | name the stationary element |

Condition 2 (the blind-operand backstop) is written against a single result axis and does
not run here. "Every element must move" covers a *primary* per-lane operand left full
width, but not a *secondary* one no element's shape depends on; no registered
tuple-returning operator has one, and a new one surfaces in the blind inventory first.

A position that is scratch only in *some* arities cannot be declared:
`tile.mrgsort_format2`'s `tmp_or_src2` is a third sorted input in a 3/4-way merge
and workspace in a 2-way one, and the arity is the positional argument count. It
needs no declaration in practice — the deducer sizes the result from whichever
position holds `tmp` (always the last), so type consistency decides that position at
every arity, and the remaining positions are real sorted inputs that must be sharded.

### Carries, merges and dropped axes

Four places rewrite state *around* the halving rather than in it, and each must
follow the same axis and tracking rules or the conditions above misfire:

- **A store reached as the return expression.** `LocalizeStoreOffset` moves a
  `tile.store` of a tracked tile to this lane's half, and the *statement shape*
  decides whether it is reached. `return pl.tile.store(v, [0, 0], out)` is ordinary
  DSL — nothing normalizes it into an assignment — yet it is neither an `AssignStmt`
  nor an `EvalStmt`, and the AUTO arm's affinity gate skips it too (no leaf call of
  its own). `Substitute` still swaps in the halved tile, so both lanes wrote the same
  rows from different data. `LocalizeReturnStores` covers it from both arms; binding
  the store to a name first was never meant to be load-bearing.

- **Loop carries.** A carry has three edges, and all three must agree. An
  `iter_arg` inherits its init value's tracking, so a halved init makes the carry
  lane-local; the loop-exit `return_var` inherits it in turn so a later
  `tile.store` gets the per-lane offset. Both the explicit and the AUTO
  affinity-gated arms share `RepairIterArgs` / `RepairReturnVars` — the AUTO arm
  recurses through its own walk and cannot reach the explicit path's `ForStmt`
  branch, so without this a legal tile accumulator has its carry reported as a
  full-width operand.
- **The loop backedge.** The third edge is the value the body yields back into
  the carry, and `ValidateCarryBackedge` is what checks it: the yielded value
  must be lane-local exactly when the carry is. A halved carry fed a full-width
  value declares a per-lane type that contradicts the value flowing into it on
  every iteration after the first — the same defect as an un-sharded operand,
  which no operand check sees because those inspect a `Call`'s arguments and this
  is a `Yield`. The check is symmetric, so a lane-local value yielded into a
  full-width carry is rejected too. It validates rather than repairs: when the
  yielded value is tracked the trailing `Substitute` already swaps in its halved
  replacement, and when it is not there is no halved version to substitute.

  An **unbound** backedge — `pl.yield_(pl.tile.add(acc, acc))` — reaches the same
  rejection by a different route, and gets its own message. Nothing hoists an
  expression passed to `pl.yield_`, so the call stays inline in the `Yield` where
  this pass, which halves *statements*, never reaches it. The mismatch wording
  above would blame the two ends of a carry that is fine; the actionable
  instruction is to bind the value first.
- **Branch merges.** An `IfStmt`'s merge variable (`return_vars_`, a `DefField`)
  is lane-local exactly when the values its branches yield are. Left at its
  declared full width it contradicts both `Yield` values *and* stays untracked,
  so a following `tile.store` gets no lane offset and both AIV lanes write from
  output row 0 — overlapping writes instead of a half each. `RepairIfReturnVars`
  retypes it from the lowered branches, and both arms call it for the same reason
  the loop carries need two call sites. The branches must agree: one yielding a
  halved value while the other yields a full-width one has no single merge type,
  and is rejected rather than resolved by picking a side. Both branches always
  exist here: SSA requires an else wherever `return_vars_` are defined, and
  `ConvertToSSA` synthesizes the else `Yield` for a source-level no-else phi.
- **`tile.slice` with `drop_dims`.** This op has *two* axis spaces, and the pass
  crosses between them in both directions. `shape` / `offset` / `valid_shape` are
  indexed in the **pre-drop** rank; the result is those axes minus `drop_dims`,
  clamped back to 2D by *prepending* unit axes. So
  `slice([1, 256, 128], drop_dims=[0]) -> [256, 128]` puts the result's dim 0 on
  the source's dim 1, and conversely a source dim 0 can land on result dim 1.

  | Direction | Used for |
  | --------- | -------- |
  | result axis → pre-drop axis | rewriting the `shape` / `offset` / `valid_shape` tuples, which are indexed pre-drop |
  | pre-drop axis → result axis | turning a *tracked* source's split axis into the axis that indexes the result type |

  The second direction is the one a tracked source needs: the split axis is
  carried on the **operand**, while the halving path indexes the **result**.
  Assuming they coincide made a source axis 0 read the result's synthetic unit
  axis, take the singleton early-return, and pass the slice through untouched
  while its source was halved underneath it — a 16-row window over an 8-row
  source. Both mappings are expressed over the same surviving-axis list, so they
  are inverses **over the surviving axes**. The synthetic unit axes the 2D clamp
  prepends have no pre-drop counterpart: result → pre-drop returns them
  unchanged, and pre-drop → result never produces them, so neither round-trips
  through the other there.

## The affinity gate

Only **vector** work is halved; cube work stays full. Affinity is decided by
`core_affinity::ClassifyCallAffinity` (memory-space driven): an op producing or
consuming a `Vec` tile is `VECTOR`; matmul operands and the Acc/Mat cube result
are `CUBE`. `tile.aiv_shard` is the seam — FULL cube tile in, HALF vector tile
out — and `CheckNoCubeTileHalved` is the backstop.

## Example — cube→vector boundary, vector region halved (UpDown)

A mixed kernel: a cube tile (`Mat`) crosses to `Vec`, a vector `add` runs on
it, the result is stored.

**Before** (post-InferTileMemorySpace mixed `InCore`):

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore, attrs={"split": pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN})
def split_auto(qk: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat],
               out_0: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]]):
    popped: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.move(qk, target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
    y: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.add(popped, popped)
    return pl.store(y, [0, 0], out_0)
```

**After** (flat fallback: the return expression uses the lane index outside
the candidate region):

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore,
             attrs={"split": pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN, "split_aiv": True})
def split_auto(qk, out_0):
    subblock_idx: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = pl.tile.get_subblock_idx()
    popped: pl.Tile[[64, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.aiv_shard(qk, split=1)  # C->V, HALF
    y: pl.Tile[[64, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.add(popped, popped)
    return pl.store(y, [0 + subblock_idx * 64, 0], out_0)
```

The cube operand `qk` stays `[128, 128]`; the vector sub-region is halved to
`[64, 128]` and the store offset is localized per subblock.

## Example — vector→cube boundary stays full (UpDown)

A V→C `tile.move` becomes `tile.aic_gather`; the cube placement move on the
gathered tile keeps the FULL `[128, 128]` `Mat` shape — the cube side never
sees a halved tile:

```python
# `v` is the per-lane HALF the affinity gate produced, e.g. [64, 128].
gathered_mat: pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.aic_gather(v, split=1)
gathered:     pl.Tile[[128, 128], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.move(gathered_mat,
                                                                      target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
```

**The operand must be a per-lane half.** `tile.aic_gather` is declared
HALF → FULL, so the gather doubles `[64, 128] → [128, 128]`, which is exactly the
FULL result type the cube placement move keeps. That agreement is a
*precondition*, not a guarantee: a VECTOR value can reach the boundary un-halved
— a `Vec` parameter used directly, or a tile whose split dim is a singleton the
affinity gate deliberately preserves. Doubling such an operand would produce a
`[256, 128]` gather feeding a move still typed `[128, 128]`, contradicting
`tile.move`'s shape-preserving contract and yielding IR that does not survive
print→parse. There is no correct gather for a value with no half, so the pass
**rejects** it with an actionable `ValueError`:

```text
LowerAutoVectorSplit: the V->C boundary tile.move here carries a full-width
vector operand 'vec'. tile.aic_gather reassembles the two AIV lanes' per-lane
halves into the full tile the cube expects, so its operand must be a value the
split halving produced (a tile.load / tile.slice / elementwise result inside the
vector sub-region). An un-halved value has no half to gather — either derive the
per-lane half first (load or slice the value inside the split function) and move
that to the cube side, or, if the split axis is a singleton that cannot be
halved, keep the value on the vector side.
```

**The gather follows the operand's split axis, not the function's.** A
`tile.reshape` can migrate the split axis — the rms_norm `[N, 1] ↔ [1, N]` column
reshape moves it from dim 0 to dim 1 — and `TileInfo::split_dim` tracks where it
ended up. The gather is emitted with the `split` encoding of *that* dim
(`dim 0 → 1`, `dim 1 → 2`), so a `[1, 8]` lane-local operand under an `UpDown`
function gathers to `[1, 16]` via `split=2`, matching the move. Doubling the
function axis instead would yield `[2, 8]`. A tracked split dim outside `{0, 1}`
cannot be expressed as a `split` attr on a 2D gather and is rejected.

The gather result is `Mat`, not `Vec`: the declared type of a boundary op names
the **consuming** lane's space, and AIC pops a V→C transfer into L1. (`Vec` would
name the *producing* lane, contradicting the mirror op `tile.aiv_shard`, which
declares the vector-side `Vec` for its cube-produced operand.) The cube placement
move that follows is what puts the tile in its final operand space — `Mat → Left`
for a matmul operand; the `Mat → Mat` shown here is a no-op that survives only
because the pass preserves the author's original move.

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

```cpp
Pass LowerAutoVectorSplit();
```

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/lower_auto_vector_split_pass.cpp`

- `LowerFunction` / `LowerStmts` — boundary rewrite + affinity-gated halving.
- `MakeReshapeOpCall` — builds `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather` calls.
- `CheckNoCubeTileHalved` — cube-operand integrity backstop.
- `WithSplitAivAttrs` — stamps `split` + `split_aiv`.

**Shared machinery**: `src/ir/transforms/utils/split_axis_utils.cpp`
(`ProcessStmts`, `InjectSubblockIdx`, `SplitDimension`, `IsReduceOnSplitAxis`) —
the per-op vector halving, shared with `SplitVectorKernel`'s
`ProcessStandaloneSplitFunction` and the `AivSplitValid` verifier.

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

```cpp
passes.def("lower_auto_vector_split", &pass::LowerAutoVectorSplit, ...);
```

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_lower_auto_vector_split.py`, plus the
end-to-end `pl.split` golden scenarios in
`tests/st/codegen/torch/test_torch_codegen_cross_core.py`.
