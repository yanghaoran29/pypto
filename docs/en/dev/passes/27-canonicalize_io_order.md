# CanonicalizeIOOrder Pass

Scoped to `SeqStmts` **inside a `ForKind::Pipeline` body**, reorders statements along a **same-core hardware-unit stage ladder** (scalar → load → compute → store) — subject to the SSA dependency graph — so that each stage clusters across the replicated clones produced by `LowerPipelineLoops`. Clustering keeps sibling-iteration tiles co-live, which is what enables ping-pong (double-buffering). Cross-core (cube/vector) pipelines are software-pipelined upstream by [`SkewCrossCorePipeline`](25-skew_cross_core_pipeline.md) and reach this pass as `ForKind::Sequential`, so there is no cross-core handling here. Loops that are not pipelined are left untouched.

## Overview

After `LowerPipelineLoops` produces an outer `ForStmt` (kind=Pipeline marker) whose body is a `SeqStmts` of `F` cloned bodies, the natural emission order is `[scalar_0, load_0, compute_0, store_0, scalar_1, load_1, compute_1, store_1, …]` (each clone's address arithmetic precedes its own load). With this layout, sibling clones' tile live ranges are sequential — `MemoryReuse` happily coalesces them into a single buffer, defeating ping-pong.

This pass reorders `SeqStmts` **inside a `ForKind::Pipeline` body** (including nested `IfStmt` branch bodies inside the pipeline scope) so:

- Each scalar-producing compute (typically address arithmetic) floats to the earliest position the dependency graph permits, so it unblocks downstream loads.
- Each `tile.load` / `tile.read` floats to the earliest position the dependency graph permits.
- Tile compute statements settle in the middle.
- Each `tile.store` / `tile.write` sinks to the latest position the dependency graph permits.

The result is `[scalars…, loads…, tile compute…, stores…]` whenever the dataflow allows. Within replicated regions, sibling clones' input tiles become co-live near the top and output tiles become co-live near the bottom — `MemoryReuse` cannot coalesce them, so each clone keeps its own MemRef and ping-pong buffering becomes possible.

Lifting scalar compute is what unlocks the load cluster: without it, each clone's address-arithmetic assign would be classified as ordinary compute and rank by original position — interleaving between sibling loads and pinning them in their original groups. With scalar compute as the highest-priority category, all sibling clones' address arithmetic emits first, all dependent loads become ready together, and the loads naturally cluster.

### Cross-core (AIC↔AIV) — handled upstream

Cross-core (cube/vector) pipeline loops are software-pipelined by [`SkewCrossCorePipeline`](25-skew_cross_core_pipeline.md), which runs *before* `LowerPipelineLoops` and rewrites every cross-core loop to `ForKind::Sequential`. They therefore never reach this pass as a `ForKind::Pipeline` body, and `CanonicalizeIOOrder` has **no cross-core handling** — `tpush`/`tpop` are ordinary tile compute here, not reordered into any cross-core tier. This pass only clusters the **same-core** stages (scalar → load → compute → store) of the remaining same-core pipeline loops (GM→L1, L1→L0, nested matmul) for ping-pong.

**Requires**: SSAForm, SplitIncoreOrch, IncoreTileOps, TileOps2D, TileMemoryInferred, NormalizedStmtStructure.

**Pipeline position**: After `LowerPipelineLoops`, before `InitMemRef` (slot 20.6). Running before `InitMemRef` keeps SSAForm intact for the dependency analysis. On exit the pass demotes the outer pipeline loop's `kind_` from `ForKind::Pipeline` → `ForKind::Sequential` and strips any stale `pipeline_stages` attr — `ForKind::Pipeline` is a transient marker that must not survive past this pass.

## Algorithm

A priority-aware stable topological sort applied to every `SeqStmts` of two or more statements **inside a `ForKind::Pipeline` body**. The mutator maintains a pipeline-depth counter: it increments on entry to a `ForKind::Pipeline` loop, decrements on exit, and reorders `SeqStmts` only when the counter is non-zero. Each top-level statement is categorized:

| Category | Priority | Hardware unit | Examples |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| `ScalarCompute` | 0 (emit first) | scalar | `AssignStmt` whose LHS is a `ScalarType` (e.g. `off = i * 64`) |
| `Load` | 1 | MTE ingress (GM→L1/L0) | `AssignStmt(_, Call("tile.load", …))` / `tile.read` / L1→L0 `tile.extract` |
| `TileCompute` | 2 | CUBE/Vec compute | Everything else (matmul loops, elementwise, `tile.move`, `tpush`/`tpop` — see note) |
| `Store` | 3 (emit last) | MTE egress (L1/L0→GM) | `tile.store` / `tile.write` (AssignStmt or EvalStmt) |

`tile.read` is classified as `Load` even though it produces a scalar — it's I/O against a tile and belongs in the load tier alongside `tile.load`. The LHS-type check only applies once the RHS is determined not to be a recognized I/O op.

Cross-core `tpush`/`tpop` carry no special category — they fall through to `TileCompute` and keep their program order among siblings (cross-core software-pipelining is done upstream by [`SkewCrossCorePipeline`](25-skew_cross_core_pipeline.md); see *Cross-core (AIC↔AIV)* above).

At each step, among statements whose predecessors are all already emitted (`ready`), the pass emits the one with the smallest `(category, original_index)`. Stores naturally sort last because `Store` is the largest category — they are only emitted once nothing else is ready.

Worked example — input `[scalar_0, load_0, compute_0, store_0, scalar_1, load_1, compute_1, store_1]` with each clone's load reading its scalar, each compute reading its load, each store reading both its scalar and compute:

```text
ready={scalar_0, scalar_1}              emit scalar_0    (cat 0, idx 0)
ready={load_0, scalar_1}                emit scalar_1    (cat 0 < cat 1)
ready={load_0, load_1}                  emit load_0      (cat 1, idx 1 < 5)
ready={load_1, compute_0}               emit load_1      (cat 1 < cat 2)
ready={compute_0, compute_1}            emit compute_0
ready={compute_1, store_0}              emit compute_1   (cat 2 < cat 6)
ready={store_0, store_1}                emit store_0
ready={store_1}                         emit store_1
```

Output: `[scalar_0, scalar_1, load_0, load_1, compute_0, compute_1, store_0, store_1]`.

## Correctness

The reorder is a topological sort over the SSA def-use dependency graph, so it preserves all dataflow. Soundness rests on two utilities from `stmt_dependency_analysis.h`:

1. `CollectInOutUseDisciplineDiagnostics(region, program)` — reports any user-function call that passes a variable as `InOut`/`Out` while a later statement still reads it. Since PR #1039 this is a structural IR invariant (RFC #1026): every function in valid IR satisfies it. The pass runs this check once per function — not per `SeqStmts`, since variable scopes don't cross function boundaries — and skips reordering for any function that reports a violation (to stay sound even under `VerificationLevel.NONE`).
2. `BuildStmtDependencyGraph(region, program)` — produces a sound def-use DAG over the region's top-level statements, given the discipline holds. The pass passes `nullptr` for `program` since the discipline check has already been performed at function scope.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Reason |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Function must satisfy the InOut-use discipline | Required for sound dataflow analysis (structural invariant since PR #1039); per-function check skips reordering otherwise |
| Aborts on cyclic dependency graph | Should be impossible for an SSA region; raised as `INTERNAL_CHECK` |

## Example

**Before** (input from `LowerPipelineLoops` — note the outer loop still carries the `kind=Pipeline` marker, and the per-clone scalar address-arithmetic assigns):

```python
for i in pl.pipeline(0, 8, 4, stage=1):  # kind=Pipeline (marker); attr=1 post-LowerPipelineLoops
    off_0: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = i * 128
    tile_x_0 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_0], [128])
    tile_y_0 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_0, 1.0)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_0, [off_0], output)
    off_1: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = (i + 1) * 128
    tile_x_1 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_1], [128])
    tile_y_1 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_1, 1.0)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_1, [off_1], output)
    # ... k=2, k=3 ...
```

**After** (kind demoted to Sequential; body reordered):

```python
for i in pl.range(0, 8, 4):  # kind=Sequential
    off_0: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = i * 128
    off_1: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = (i + 1) * 128
    off_2: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = (i + 2) * 128
    off_3: pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX] = (i + 3) * 128
    tile_x_0 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_0], [128])
    tile_x_1 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_1], [128])
    tile_x_2 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_2], [128])
    tile_x_3 = pl.tile.load(input_a, [off_3], [128])
    tile_y_0 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_0, 1.0)
    tile_y_1 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_1, 1.0)
    tile_y_2 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_2, 1.0)
    tile_y_3 = pl.tile.add(tile_x_3, 1.0)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_0, [off_0], output)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_1, [off_1], output)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_2, [off_2], output)
    pl.tile.store(tile_y_3, [off_3], output)
```

All four `off_k` lift first to unblock the loads. All four `tile_x_k` are now co-live up to the last load, and all four `tile_y_k` are co-live up to the first store. `MemoryReuse` (running next) cannot merge them — each gets a distinct MemRef.
