# ConvertTensorToTileOps Pass

Converts tensor operations to tile operations in InCore functions and updates orchestration call sites.

## Overview

After `OutlineIncoreScopes` extracts InCore scopes into separate functions, those functions still operate on `TensorType` variables using `tensor.*` operations. This pass lowers them to `TileType` variables with `tile.*` operations that map directly to PTO-ISA instructions.

The pass also updates call sites in orchestration/opaque functions: for each new output parameter added to an InCore function, a `tensor.create` is inserted at the call site.

**Requirements**:

- Input IR must be in SSA form
- InCore scopes must be outlined (run `OutlineIncoreScopes` first)
- Statement structure must be normalized

**When to use**: Run after `OutlineClusterScopes` and before `OptimizeOrchTensors`.

## API

| C++ | Python | Level |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| `pass::ConvertTensorToTileOps()` | `passes.convert_tensor_to_tile_ops()` | Program-level |

**Python usage**:

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

convert_pass = passes.convert_tensor_to_tile_ops()
program_tiled = convert_pass(program)
```

## Algorithm

The pass operates in three program-level phases:

### Phase 1: Transform InCore Functions

For each `FunctionType::InCore` function:

1. **Pre-scan consumer memory demand** (`ConsumerSpaceCollector`): Collect, for every variable, the memory space its downstream consumers need, driven by the `input_reqs` declared in `OpConversionRegistry`. A `tensor.slice` feeding `tensor.matmul` is the motivating case — it needs a Mat `tile.load` (natural, plus a zero-copy `tile.transpose_view` when transposed) rather than landing in Vec and being moved out again — but the mechanism is general, not matmul-specific.

2. **Analyze writes and share read-only loads**: Before conversion, trace writes through GM aliases and control flow using operator argument effects. A parameter used by a default tile-input converter may share an entry `tile.load` only when it is not written in the function. Writes to local values derived from a parameter also conservatively disable sharing for that parameter. Calls with opaque effects disable entry-load sharing. The loaded tile lives in a separate operand cache; the GM parameter retains its identity and type. Load space follows consumer demand, or remains unset for `InferTileMemorySpace` to determine.

3. **Convert body via TensorToTileMutator**: Convert each registered call using `OpConversionRegistry`. `BridgeInputSpaces` supplies tile operands at the consuming statement, reusing read-only entry loads for default inputs or loading mutable GM operands at each use. Memory converters retain their GM operands and perform their own loading/storing. Local computed results still map to tiles. A value-flow analysis identifies tile-valued loop/branch results: GM handles carried through writes remain GM, while computed carries receive tile seeds and compatible yields.

4. **Insert tile.store (exit stores)**: For each return value converted from `TensorType` to `TileType`, add an `Out` parameter and insert `tile.store(tile, zeros, out_param)`. If the return value comes from a `tile.assemble` loop, the loop is rewritten to use `tile.store` directly (conversion-time assemble-loop rewrite; distinct from `OptimizeOrchTensors` Pattern 3 which handles cross-function optimization).

5. **Upgrade written param directions**: An alias-origin analysis (`AnalyzeCallAccess`) attributes every read/write back to the parameter it originates from, then upgrades each `In` param that is written to `Out` (write-only) or `InOut` (read and written). Which argument an operator writes is **not** decided here — it is read from that operator's registry declaration (`set_arg_effect`, see [Operators](../ir/05-operators.md#argument-effects)), so `tile.store`, `tile.mscatter`, `tensor.write`, `tensor.assemble`, `tensor.expand_clone`, the `pld.tile.*` / `pld.tensor.*` push and pull family, `pld.system.notify`, `system.syncall` and the composite collectives all reach the same analysis through one table. An argument declared `Write` is not counted as a read: a store landing on a sub-region never reads the untouched remainder. Kwarg-dependent effects resolve per call, so an atomic store or an `AtomicAdd` notify marks its destination read+write while the plain forms do not. Params the user already declared `Out` / `InOut` are left as-is.

   An operator that never declared its effects still counts as reading every argument. That default is now confined to operators the registry has nothing to say about — most of them functional — rather than being the fallback for a hand-maintained list that a new write operator silently escaped.

### GM Identity and Read/Write Ordering

Loading a GM tensor for computation creates a tile value, not an alias that can
replace every use of the tensor. For example, this kernel computes from `x` and
then changes one GM element:

```python
@pl.jit.incore
def kernel(
    x: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor[[16, 32], pl.FP32]],
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[16, 1], pl.FP32]],
):
    r = pl.row_max(x)
    out[0:16, 0:1] = r
    pl.tensor.write(x, [0, 0], pl.const(1.0, pl.FP32))
    return out
```

The reduction receives a `tile.load(x, ...)` result. The final write remains
`tensor.write(x, ...)`, emitted as a GM `pto.store_scalar`; it does not become a
`tile.write` into the reduction's input tile. The same rule applies to
`pld.DistributedTensor` parameters, scalar reads, and returned GM aliases.

When a later computation reads `x` after a GM write, it loads the updated value
at that statement. Mutable GM loads are not shared across writes, branches, or
loop iterations. Returning another tensor, or returning nothing, does not
discard the GM write. `InOut` describes argument effects; it does not request an
unconditional whole-tensor store at function exit.

### GM Store Coherence Restriction

An InCore function may not combine a bulk store (`tensor.assemble`, lowered to
`tile.store`) with `tensor.write` on the same underlying GM tensor. The bulk
store uses MTE3 while the scalar store uses the D-cache path; barriers alone do
not guarantee cache-line coherence between those paths on A2/A3. The pass
therefore rejects the combination instead of emitting code that can silently
lose either the scalar overrides or neighbouring bulk-written bytes.

Before applying the restriction, the pass canonicalizes a simple constant
scalar-fill loop into `tensor.full` plus `tensor.assemble`, which then lowers to
`tile.full` plus `tile.store`. The loop must be sequential, zero-based, and
unit-stride; its body may contain one or more `tensor.write` operations and
nothing else. Each write must cover a contiguous region with one loop-invariant
constant value, and the flattened region must satisfy MTE3's 32-byte row
alignment. This keeps full-block fallback fills on the MTE3 path instead of
rejecting them as mixed stores. Dynamic values, non-canonicalizable partial
updates, unaligned regions, and strided scalar loops remain on the D-cache path.

The pass also stages a full-tensor `tensor.full` initialization followed only by
scalar updates to that tensor. The scalar updates are redirected to the local
tile, and one `tile.store` writes the completed value to GM at function exit.
This supports dynamic sparse-map construction without mixing MTE3 and D-cache
stores. The rewrite requires a zero-offset, full-shape initialization backed by
a private `tensor.full` result; partial initialization, aliases, additional DMA
stores, or other uses of the GM target remain rejected.

The check follows assignment aliases and loop/branch carries. It is deliberately
conservative: it rejects mixed store paths to one GM tensor even when source
offsets appear disjoint, because the compiler does not yet prove cache-line
separation across symbolic views and control flow. Mixed paths to distinct GM
tensors remain valid.

```python
# Rejected: a partial assignment becomes MTE3 TSTORE, then pl.write uses D-cache.
output[0:1, 0:16] = pl.full([1, 16], dtype=pl.INT32, value=-1)
for i in pl.range(4):
    pl.write(output, [0, i], pl.cast(i, pl.INT32))

# Supported: update the local on-chip value, then issue one GM store.
staged = pl.full([1, 32], dtype=pl.INT32, value=-1)
for i in pl.range(4):
    pl.write(staged, [0, i], pl.cast(i, pl.INT32))
output[0:1, 0:32] = staged
```

Using `tensor.write` for every element is also supported when a single bulk
store is not practical.

### Cache-Policy Declarations → `tile.load` `cache` Kwarg

This pass is where a declared GM cache policy stops being metadata and becomes
part of the access. [`OutlineIncoreScopes`](09-outline_incore_scopes.md) left the
declarations on the InCore function as the `cache_policy` attr —
`std::vector<std::pair<int32_t, int>>` (param index, `CachePolicy` as int).
Phase 1 turns those indices back into param `Var` identities once per function,
then adds `{"cache", <policy>}` to every `tile.load` whose source arg is a listed
param: the entry loads it synthesises, the consumer-driven Mat loads, the
input-space bridge loads, and any `tile.load` already in the body (user-written
or produced by an earlier pass). The attr is **erased** when the transformed
function is rebuilt — nothing downstream may see it, because its param indices go
stale the moment a later pass grows the param list.

Precedence is per access: an explicit `pl.load(..., cache=...)` kwarg already on
the load always wins over the scope declaration, in both directions, so
`cache=pl.CachePolicy.DEFAULT` opts one read back into the cache inside a
bypassing scope. From here the kwarg simply rides the op through the remaining
passes to codegen, the way `target_memory` does. See
[GM Cache-Access Policy](../language/05-cache-policy.md).

### Phase 2a: Propagate Added Outputs Through Spmd/Group Wrappers

`OutlineClusterScopes` produces Spmd/Group wrappers that are transparent 1:1
forwarders of their params to a single inner InCore call. When Phase 1 appends
`Out` params to that InCore callee, the wrapper must mirror the appended params
on its own signature and forward them through the inner call — otherwise
orchestration codegen's `BuildWrapperReorderedParams` invariant (every inner-call
`Var` arg resolves to a wrapper param) breaks.

For each `FunctionType::Spmd` / `FunctionType::Group` function:

1. `ForwardedCallFinder` locates the first call to a transformed InCore (one
   whose Phase 1 added at least one `Out` param).
2. If found, the wrapper signature is extended with matching `Out` params (same
   type as the InCore's appended params, reusing the `name_hint_`), and
   `WrapperForwardMutator` rewrites the inner call to append the new vars as
   forward args and adopt the callee's new return type. `tensor.create` is
   *not* synthesised in the wrapper — allocation remains the caller's
   responsibility.
3. If no forwarded transformed-InCore call is found, the wrapper is left
   unchanged.

### Phase 2b: Update Orchestration Call Sites

For each orchestration / opaque function that calls a transformed InCore
function or a wrapper that absorbed output params in Phase 2a:

1. Insert `tensor.create` for each added output parameter
2. Append created tensors as extra arguments to the call

InCore, Spmd, and Group functions are skipped from this phase — they were
already rewritten in Phase 1 / 2a.

## Where a Bridged Load Lands

An operand listed in a conversion's `input_reqs` reaches the converter as a tile:
if it is still a `TensorType`, `BridgeInputSpaces` synthesizes the `tile.load`.
That load has to name a memory space, and the space is **derived from the
consuming operator's own declaration**, never written a second time here.

Each entry names the operand rather than the space:

```cpp
// tensor.matmul: lhs and rhs are bridged as the cube operands of whichever
// matmul the rank dispatch emits.
{{0, {BridgeSpaceOf({"tile.matmul", "tile.batch_matmul"}, 0), "a_trans", /*cube_m_axis=*/true}},
 {1, {BridgeSpaceOf({"tile.matmul", "tile.batch_matmul"}, 1), "b_trans"}}}
```

`BridgeSpaceOf` reads that argument's `set_input_memory` constraint out of
`OpRegistry` and stages it through `StagingSpaceForLoad`. `OpRegistry` is
therefore the single place an operand's memory space is stated, for this pass and
for [`InferTileMemorySpace`](20-infer_tile_memory_space.md) alike.

**A registration cannot write a space of its own.** `InputSpaceReq::demanded_space`
is an `OperandSpace`, a type with no public constructor and no conversion from
`MemorySpace`, so `{MemorySpace::Vec, ...}` does not compile. The only way to
obtain one is `BridgeSpaceOf` / `OperandSpaceOf`, which is what makes "derived,
never authored" an invariant of the type rather than a convention the next
registration can quietly ignore.

**A requirement names every operator that can consume the operand.** The list is
braced even when there is one (`BridgeSpaceOf({"tile.sel"}, 2)`). It matters when
a converter dispatches: `tensor.matmul` emits `tile.matmul` for a 2-D operand and
`tile.batch_matmul` for an ND one, so deriving from the flat op alone would read
an operator an ND call never becomes. All listed operators must declare the same
constraint. That agreement is structural rather than lucky —
[`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](14-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) unrolls the batched op into
the flat one, so the same operand lands in the same buffer either way — and a
divergence throws instead of silently bridging against the wrong name.

**The constraint and the load target are different spaces, and that is the
point.** `tile.matmul` constrains its operands to `Left` / `Right` — L0A and L0B
— but MTE2 fills no L0 buffer, so a load can never satisfy the constraint
directly:

| Operand constraint | Load lands in | Last hop |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| `Vec` | `Vec` | none |
| `Mat` | `Mat` | none |
| `Left` / `Right` / `Bias` / `LeftScale` / `RightScale` | `Mat` | `tile.move` added by `InferTileMemorySpace` Phase 2 |
| `Acc` | — | not loadable; an accumulator must be *created* in L0C |

`StagingSpaceForLoad` (`src/ir/memref.cpp`) holds that table, and
`InferTileMemorySpace` applies the same function when it retargets a producer it
placed itself — so a bridged load and an inferred load put the same operand in
the same buffer.

**Failures are loud and early.** Naming an unregistered operator, or one that
declares no `set_input_memory` for that argument, throws while the conversion
registry is being built rather than leaving the bridge with a plausible-looking
default. A new operator cannot silently fall into the gap between the two
registries.

**Not every operand goes through this.** Two other mechanisms place a tile, and
neither is a missing declaration:

- **Self-loading ops** (`tensor.slice`, `tensor.gather`, `tensor.paged_gather`,
  `tensor.gather_row`, `tensor.assemble`, …) synthesize their own loads inside
  the converter, because the load's shape or offset is part of the lowering.
- **Inherit-input ops** (`tile.assemble`, `tile.gather_row`) declare
  `set_output_memory_inherit_input()` or `set_output_reuses_input(idx)`. Their
  space follows the tile they are given — `Mat` for an L1 paged-gather
  accumulator, `Vec` for a UB one — so pinning it with `set_input_memory` would
  force a wrong `tile.move` instead of describing the hardware.

## MatmulSlice Pattern

This is the motivating instance of the general `input_reqs` flow above, not a
mechanism of its own. When `tensor.slice` feeds into `tensor.matmul` or
`tensor.matmul_acc`, the slice must produce a Mat-space tile instead of a
Vec-space tile. `ConsumerSpaceCollector` reads that demand off the matmul's
`input_reqs` like any other consumer's, and the producer answers it with a
natural Mat `tile.load`; a transposed operand (`a_trans` for LHS, `b_trans` for
RHS) gets a zero-copy `tile.transpose_view` at the matmul site. Nothing here
matches on the operator being a matmul — an operand of any op declaring a
non-Vec requirement reaches its producer the same way.

The demand is propagated **through** zero-copy metadata ops that declare `set_output_memory_inherit_input()` — `tensor.slice`, `tensor.view`, `tensor.reshape`, `tensor.reinterpret_view`, `tensor.set_validshape`. So an operand written as `pl.matmul(pl.set_validshape(a[:, :K], rows, K), b)` still loads straight to Mat. An op that aliases its input's storage but omits that declaration breaks the chain: the operand materializes in Vec and needs a `tile.move` to Mat, which is a vector→cube boundary that flips an otherwise pure-CUBE InCore scope to `MIXED` and makes [`ExpandMixedKernel`](24-expand_mixed_kernel.md) split it into an AIC/AIV pair.

## Cube Operand M-Axis Boxing

A cube operand has two independent extents, and only one of them is constrained.

- The **logical** extent is essentially free. `pto.tmatmul` derives `M`, `K`, and
  `N` from the operands' *valid* region, bounded at `[1, 4095]` with no
  divisibility rule; `pto.mad` carries a `disable_gemv` clause whose whole
  purpose is selecting the L0A organization at `%m == 1`.
- The **physical** extent must be a whole number of NZ fractal boxes. A box is
  16 rows tall on every generation and dtype; it is
  `32 bytes / sizeof(dtype)` wide (16 for FP16, 32 for INT8). ptoas enforces it
  directly — `'pto.alloc_tile' op expects result boxed tile rows to be a
  multiple of innerRows (16)` — and pto-isa's `TExtract` repeats it as a static
  assertion on the Mat source it reads.

So every cube tile the matmul's M axis runs through is allocated with that extent
rounded up to the box, and the tensor's true extent declared as `valid_shape`:

```python
# Before  (M = 100)
y = tensor.matmul(a, b)          # a: Tensor[[100, 256]]

# After
a_mat = pl.tile.load(a, [0, 0], [112, 256], [100, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
y_tile = pl.tile.matmul(a_mat, b_mat)   # Tile[[112, 512]] valid [100, 512]
```

The padding is free on both axes of the cost model. A `tile.load` moves only the
valid extent, so the DMA is unchanged; and the MAD cost is `ceil(M/16)` passes,
which rounding M up to a multiple of 16 leaves unchanged. The hardware addresses
the narrower valid region inside the full box through compact mode, and
`tile.store` writes only the valid rows, so the observable result is identical.

Making M a multiple of 16 here is also what keeps
[`AutoTileMatmulL0`](18-auto_tile_matmul_l0.md) legal at the boundary: that pass
picks a 16-aligned tile and peels the remainder, and a multiple of 16 can only be
split into 16-aligned pieces, tail included. It therefore needs no boundary
special case.

### Which axis carries M

M does not always land on the row axis. An `a_trans` operand is loaded
*naturally* and reinterpreted by a zero-copy `tile.transpose_view`, so its
loaded tile has `K` on rows and `M` on **columns** — the box rule follows M to
whichever axis holds it (`InputSpaceReq::cube_m_axis` resolves the axis from the
operand's own transpose flag):

```python
# a: Tensor[[128, 100]], a_trans=True — M is the load's column extent
a_mat = pl.tile.load(a, [0, 0], [128, 112], [128, 100], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
a_t   = pl.tile.transpose_view(a_mat)   # Tile[[112, 128]] valid [100, 128]
```

That also means the *granularity* differs per tile even though the padded extent
must not: an Acc box is 16 rows for every dtype, while a transposed operand's
column box is `32 / sizeof(dtype)`. A transposed INT8 operand therefore needs 32,
and the accumulator paired with it has to adopt that same 32 — each taking its
own would give a 128-row product against a 112-row accumulator, which
`tile.matmul_acc` rejects. `InputSpaceReq::m_align_from_arg` names the left
operand as the single decider, and the alignment is the lcm of its box and the
accumulator's 16 rows (every granularity involved is a power of two, so the lcm
is the max).

The rule rides on the *demand*, not on one code path. Four sites can answer a
matmul's operand requirement, and all four box: `BridgeInputSpaces` for an operand
that is still a tensor at the call; `HandleConsumerDrivenLoad` when a
`tensor.slice` (or any `set_output_memory_inherit_input()` chain) answers it at
the producer; the Phase-1 entry loop when the producer is a parameter, which
is what a `pl.matmul(pl.set_validshape(a, ...), b)` reaches; and
`HandleBoxedAccCreate` for an accumulator, which is allocated rather than loaded.
`ConsumerSpaceReq` therefore carries the box flag alongside the memory space. When
several consumers share one producer, the rows are boxed only if every one of them
asks for it, so a consumer that reads the tile at its declared physical shape is
never handed a padded one.

### `tensor.matmul_acc` boxes its accumulator with its operand

`tensor.matmul_acc` takes exactly `tensor.matmul`'s M constraint, because the two
cube tiles the M axis runs through must be boxed *together*: `tile.matmul_acc`
requires the accumulator and the matrix product to agree on physical M, so boxing
the left operand alone would trade a ptoas rejection for an operand-mismatch one.

The accumulator is never loaded — nothing but the matrix unit writes L0C — so its
allocation is the site that answers the demand. `HandleBoxedAccCreate` rewrites
the `tensor.create` that seeds it, and the narrowing rides on a separate
`tile.set_validshape` because `tile.create` takes no valid extent:

```python
# Before  (M = 100)
acc = pl.create_tensor([100, 64], pl.FP32)
c = pl.matmul_acc(acc, a, b)

# After
acc_storage = pl.tile.create([112, 64], dtype=pl.FP32, target_memory=pl.Mem.Acc, compact=True)
acc_tile = pl.tile.set_validshape(acc_storage, 100, 64)   # Tile[[112, 64]] valid [100, 64]
a_mat = pl.tile.load(a, [0, 0], [112, 128], [100, 128], target_memory=pl.Mem.Mat)
c_tile = pl.tile.matmul_acc(acc_tile, a_mat, b_mat)
```

Two details this path settles that the operand path does not:

- **The space is stated, not left to [`InferTileMemorySpace`](20-infer_tile_memory_space.md).**
  The plain `tensor.create` conversion deliberately leaves `target_memory` unset,
  having no consumer context to derive it from; here there is one, and it is the
  same demand that asked for the boxing. Stating it also matters for correctness:
  an Acc tile's implicit view is boxed NZ, so a seed left unresolved would carry
  the raw row-major view and disagree with the `tile.matmul_acc` result it is
  carried against across a split-K loop.
- **The demand crosses the loop carry.** A split-K accumulator is allocated before
  the loop and reaches its `tile.matmul_acc` as an `IterArg`, so
  `ConsumerSpaceCollector` matches operands with `AsVarLike` (an `IterArg` carries
  its own `ObjectKind`) and records a propagation edge from each `IterArg` to the
  value that seeds it.

The boxed accumulator is declared **compact**. `mad` lays the product out at a
pitch of `ceil(validRow/16)*16` — 112 for a 100-row product — while a
non-compact reader derives its stride from the physical row count, which the box
rounded to 112 or, at a 32-row alignment, to 128. Compact makes every reader
recompute the pitch `mad` actually used; without it `AccCompactValid` rejects the
program (issue #2470).

### The `N` granularity

`M`'s alignment reconciles the tiles it runs through — a `Mat` operand and its
accumulator (see `ResolveCubeMAlignment`). `N`'s has to reconcile *memory
spaces* instead, which `M`'s does not:

- the right operand is loaded into `Mat` and then promoted on to `Right` by
  [`InferTileMemorySpace`](20-infer_tile_memory_space.md), and `Right` boxes the
  same 512-byte fractal under the opposite `slayout`, which swaps the row and
  column granularities:

    | Space | `slayout` | fp32 box | fp16 box |
    | ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
    | `Mat` | `row_major` | 16 x 8 | 16 x 16 |
    | `Right` | `col_major` | 8 x 16 | 16 x 16 |

- the product lands in an `Acc`, whose `N` box is 16 for every dtype.

Both numbers are real, and ptoas asks for each against the tile that carries it,
so rounding to `Mat`'s 8 alone yields a box that clears the load and is rejected
one op later at `Right`. `ResolveCubeNAlignment` therefore takes the lcm of all
three; every granularity is a power of two, so the lcm is the maximum.

Scope, and what is deliberately left out:

| Case | Boxed? | Why |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| 2-D `tensor.matmul` left operand | Yes, on rows | Its row axis is M, whose box height is 16 for every dtype |
| 2-D `tensor.matmul_acc` left operand and accumulator | Yes, on rows | Same axis, same rule — and the op requires the two to agree on physical M, so they move together |
| `a_trans` left operand, and the accumulator paired with it | Yes, on columns | The natural load's row axis is K, so M is the column extent; the accumulator adopts that operand's column granularity via `m_align_from_arg` |
| 2-D `tensor.matmul` right operand | Yes, on the axis carrying `N` | Columns normally; rows under `b_trans`, whose natural load puts `K` on the columns. `N`'s padded cells land outside the result's valid region, so nothing reads them |
| `tensor.matmul_acc` right operand | No | Its accumulator has to agree with the product on physical `N` just as it does on `M`, which needs the same cross-tile decider reaching the `tile.create` that allocates it |
| Either operand's `K` axis | No | Padding the reduction axis would feed uninitialised L1 into the sum unless the hardware masks by valid col, which is unverified; [`AutoTileMatmulL0`](18-auto_tile_matmul_l0.md)'s `PH-AT-007` declines it for the same reason |
| Rank >= 3 operand | No | It lowers to `tile.batch_matmul`, whose rows [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](14-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) row-packs into one `[B*M, N]` tile — the box rule binds that packed extent, not this dimension |
| Dynamic extent | No | No compile-time box to round to |

Every case this pass declines still reaches a PyPTO-level error rather than a
ptoas one: [PTO codegen](../codegen/00-pto_codegen.md#boxed-tile-extents)
validates the box grid of every `pto.alloc_tile` it emits.

## Transpose Lowering

`tensor.transpose` lowers to a plain 3-arg **`tile.transpose(input, axis1, axis2)`**. The PTO `pto.ttrans` instruction needs a scratch workspace tile (same shape/dtype as the source), but that scratch is a pure codegen detail — not a semantic operand. [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](14-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) is the **sole owner** of scratch materialization: it emits the codegen-ready 4-arg form (`tile.create` + `tile.transpose(..., tmp)`) for both 2D and per-page >2D transposes, still before the memory allocator runs (so the scratch gets a real UB address). Keeping scratch out of the high-level op means `tensor.transpose` and the DSL `pl.tile.transpose(tile, axis1, axis2)` stay 1:1 with the semantic operation.

```python
# Before
y = tensor.transpose(x, 0, 1)

# After (this pass)
y_tile = pl.tile.transpose(x_tile, 0, 1)   # 3-arg, no scratch

# After FlattenTileNdTo2D (scratch materialized there)
transpose_tmp = pl.tile.create(x.shape, x.dtype, target_memory=x.memory_space)
y_tile = pl.tile.transpose(x_tile, 0, 1, transpose_tmp)
```

## Scatter Update Lowering

`tensor.scatter_update` / `tile.scatter_update` (whole-row scatter, `dim=-2` only) lower to a per-element `tile.scatter` (`pto.tscatter`) plus a `tile.sel` preserve-blend. The hardware `pto.tscatter` writes per element using a flattened destination index (`dst.flat[idx[k, c]] = src[k, c]`) and treats its `dst` operand as **write-only** (unwritten slots are not preserved), so the pass reconstructs the "keep `input` on unwritten rows" semantics itself.

The whole-row update `input[index.flat[k], :] = src[k, :]` is expressed as a flat index:

```text
flat_idx[k, c] = index.flat[k] * d + c          # d = feature width (= src cols)
```

The flat-index arithmetic is built **entirely in i32**, and only the finished row-major `[n, d]` index is narrowed to the `pto.tscatter`-required width (i16 for 2-byte data, i32 for 4-byte) via a single trailing `tile.cast`. Computing in i32 keeps every intermediate tile in a canonical, 32-byte-aligned, row-major layout — narrowing earlier would either cast a `col_major [n, 1]` view (which `tile.cast` mis-orders) or produce an unaligned 2-byte `[b, s]` tile (`cols * 2` bytes is not 32-byte aligned).

Generated PTO op sequence (FP32 `[32, 32]` input, `[2, 8]` index, `[16, 32]` src):

| # | PTO op | Produces |
| - | ------ | -------- |
| 1–3 | `pto.tload` ×3 | `input_tile`, `index_tile`, `src_tile` |
| 4 | `pto.tci` | column arange `[1, d]` = `0..d-1` |
| 5 | `pto.texpands` | zero template `[n, d]` |
| 6 | `pto.tcolexpand` | `col_nd[k, c] = c` |
| 7 | `pto.tmuls` | `row_base[k] = index.flat[k] * d` (index reshaped to `[n, 1]`) |
| 8 | `pto.trowexpandadd` | `flat_idx = col_nd + row_base` → `[n, d]` |
| 8a | `pto.tcvt` | narrow `flat_idx` i32→i16 (**2-byte dtypes only**) |
| 9 | `pto.texpands` | zeroed scatter base `[m, d]` |
| 10 | `pto.tscatter` | `scattered` = src into zeroed base (written = src, unwritten = 0) |
| 11–12 | `pto.texpands` ×2 | mask zero base `[m, d]`, ones src `[n, d]` |
| 13 | `pto.tscatter` | `mask` = ones into zeroed base (written = 1, unwritten = 0) |
| 14 | `pto.tcmps` | `pred = (mask != 0)` |
| 15 | `pto.tsel` | `out = sel(pred, scattered, input_tile)` |
| 16 | `pto.tstore` | write `out` to the output tensor |

`tile.sel` (not `input * mask`) reconstructs the preserve blend so the lowering emits no `pto.tmul`, which A2/A3 reject for bf16/i8. The index `reshape [b, s] → [n, 1]` is a buffer-view realias, not a separate PTO op.

## Paged Gather Lowering

`tensor.paged_gather(src, indices, block_table, ...)` gathers scattered rows of a paged KV pool directly into an on-chip buffer (L1 / `Mem.Mat` by default, or UB / `Mem.Vec`). The hardware `pto.tgather` instruction can only write UB, so paged-gather-to-L1 is **not** an indexed gather instruction — it is a fully-scalar per-row `GM → on-chip` DMA loop on the **Cube core (AIC)**. `src`, `indices`, and `block_table` are kept as GM tensors (the op is registered self-loading, so the framework does not preload them into Vec tiles).

The pass materializes the loop directly:

```text
rows = tensor.dim(indices, last_axis)                  # runtime gathered-row count
acc  = tile.create([max_indices, size], target_memory=space)   # static on-chip buffer
for i in [0, rows):                                    # ForStmt, iter_arg = acc
    idx   = tensor.read(indices, [i])                  # scalar GM read (pto.load_scalar)
    phys  = block_table[idx // block_size] * block_size + idx % block_size   # scalar
    acc   = tile.gather_row(acc, src, [i, 0], [phys, col_off], [1, size])    # GM->on-chip
    yield acc
```

`tile.gather_row` is a DPS op that writes one physical GM row straight into a
sub-region of the accumulator: `pto.subview` of `acc` + `pto.partition_view` of
`src` + `pto.tload` (`GM → on-chip`) — **no `pto.tmov`**. An L1→L1 `tmov` is
unsupported on a2a3 (L1 can only be filled via `GM → L1` `tload`), so the row is
loaded straight into the accumulator's sub-region rather than assembled.

Only the small index / page-table metadata is scalar-read from GM; the bulk KV data goes straight `GM → L1` via `pto.tload` and never touches UB — eliminating the GM round-trip that a `gather_kv → qk_pv` pipeline pays today. `is_trans=True` (Mat only) loads each row transposed into column offset `[0, i]`, giving the matmul B-operand layout. `max_indices` sizes the L1 buffer statically; the runtime `rows` count drives the loop bound, so dynamic gather counts are supported.

**Boxed (NZ) sub-region alignment.** An L1 (`Mem.Mat`) accumulator carries the matmul-operand NZ fractal layout, where `pto.subview` sizes must be whole multiples of the inner box (`M0 = 16` rows; `C0 = fractal_bytes / dtype_bytes / 16` cols). A per-row gather writes a single row, so `tile.gather_row` codegen emits a **box-aligned physical size** (`phys_rows = round_up(1, 16)`, `phys_cols = round_up(size, C0)`) while marking only the real extent valid (`valid = [1, size]`); the `tload` then fills just that row. UB (`Mem.Vec`, `slayout = none_box`) tiles have no inner box and use the exact `[1, size]` size. The gathered L1 tile is consumed by `tensor.matmul` directly (its natural use as a matmul operand).

### Kernel-Driven Gather (`tensor.create_l1` + `tensor.gather_row`)

`tensor.paged_gather` hardcodes its per-row source address (`block_table[idx // bs] * bs + idx % bs`). When the kernel needs arbitrary gather logic — multi-source selection, invalid-row clamping, overlay pools — it builds the same L1 accumulator itself from two tensor-level primitives, the flexible counterpart of `paged_gather`:

| Op | Lowers to | Role |
| -- | --------- | ---- |
| `tensor.create_l1(shape, dtype, transpose=...)` | `tile.create(target_memory=Mat, transpose=...)` | seed the loop-carried L1 accumulator |
| `tensor.gather_row(acc, src, dst_off, src_off, shapes, valid_shape=..., transpose=...)` | `tile.gather_row` (DPS) | DMA one **caller-addressed** GM row into `acc` |

Both deduce a `TensorType`, so the gathered result composes with tensor-level `tensor.matmul` / softmax; both are registered self-loading (`src` stays GM). The caller computes `src_off` and the `dst_off` slot, then fills the accumulator row by row in its own loop.

**Dynamic transfer length (`valid_shape`).** `shapes` must stay compile-time constant: it becomes `pto.subview`'s `sizes`, which the PTO dialect types as a static `I64ArrayAttr` (`SubViewOp` in `PTOOps.td`). The optional `valid_shape` carries the *runtime* extent instead — it feeds the subview's `valid_row` / `valid_col`, declared `Optional<Index>` SSA operands, and the GM `pto.partition_view` sizes, which accept a dynamic `?` dim. So a dynamic row count changes neither the allocation nor the box alignment below: the sub-region stays statically `shapes`-sized and only the copy length varies. Omitting `valid_shape` transfers the whole window, which is the pre-existing behaviour.

This turns a run of consecutive rows whose length is only known at runtime into one call instead of a guarded per-row loop:

```python
kv = pl.create_l1([128, HEAD_DIM], pl.BF16)
# r1 is a runtime Scalar[INDEX] — e.g. a page-boundary split point
kv = pl.gather_row(kv, pool, [0, 0],  [b0, 0], [128, HEAD_DIM], valid_shape=[r1, HEAD_DIM])
kv = pl.gather_row(kv, pool, [r1, 0], [b1, 0], [128, HEAD_DIM], valid_shape=[128 - r1, HEAD_DIM])
oi = pl.matmul(q, kv, b_trans=True)
```

**Bounds are on the written region, not the window.** `shapes` sizes the static `pto.subview`, so with a runtime `dst_offset` the declared window may reach past the destination — in the example above run 2 declares rows `[r1, r1 + 128)` on a 128-row tile. That is sound only because the transfer is bounded by `valid_shape`, not by `shapes`: the rows actually written are `[r1, r1 + (128 - r1))`, which stay inside. The caller's obligation is therefore `dst_offset + valid_shape <= dst.shape` per dimension; `dst_offset + shapes` need not fit. The two-run form above is covered on device by `test_gather_row_two_run_split`.

`valid_shape` is keyword-only in the DSL — `transpose` already owned the sixth positional slot, and taking it would silently reinterpret an existing `gather_row(..., shapes, True)` call. At the IR level it is a positional operand rather than an attr precisely because it may be a runtime value: it has to stay in the use-def chain so SSA/liveness keep the scalar alive. It is rejected together with `transpose=True` (see below) — that path would need a runtime *column* extent on a boxed NZ tile, which is unverified on device. The deducer rejects any *provable* violation of `0 <= valid_shape[i] <= shapes[i]`; a symbolic extent it cannot decide is accepted, which is the case the operand exists for.

**Transpose (ZN) for a `b_trans` matmul operand.** `transpose=True` makes the gathered tile a transposed matmul B-operand without a GM round-trip:

- `tensor.create_l1(..., transpose=True)` allocates the **transposed Mat (ZN) fractal** (`blayout = row_major`, `slayout = col_major`) — the layout a `b_trans` operand carries.
- `tensor.gather_row(..., transpose=True)` places the GM row `[r, c]` as the L1 column `[c, r]`. `pto.tload` does not transpose, so codegen presents `src` as a **DN-strided view** (`pto.make_tensor_view ... {layout = #pto.layout<dn>}`, shape/strides swapped, same base ptr) and partitions the row as a column — the `tload` then runs `DN → NZ`, which *is* the transpose. (`paged_gather`'s `is_trans=True` shares this `tile.gather_row` path.) A straight `ND → NZ` `tload` would scramble the fractal layout.

## AIV-Split Boundary Lowering (`tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather`)

`tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather` are the **`@pl.jit` / `pl.spmd` author-facing** form of the cube↔vector AIV-split boundary. They are emitted by `pl.aiv_shard(x)` / `pl.aic_gather(x)` when the operand `x` is a high-level **Tensor** (e.g. a `pl.matmul` result), inside a `for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(...)` region:

```python
raw = pl.matmul(q, k, b_trans=True, out_dtype=pl.FP32)   # Tensor, OUTSIDE the region
for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
    h = pl.aiv_shard(raw)     # C->V: tensor.aiv_shard — full [M, N] -> lane half [M/2, N]
    s = pl.softmax(h)         # AIV vector work on the half
    full = pl.aic_gather(s)   # V->C: tensor.aic_gather — halves -> full [M, N]
oi = pl.matmul(full, v, out_dtype=pl.FP32)               # Tensor, OUTSIDE the region
```

This pass lowers each **1:1** to its tile op (`tensor.aiv_shard` → `tile.aiv_shard`, `tensor.aic_gather` → `tile.aic_gather`), so from here on the IR is byte-identical to what the AUTO `pl.split` path produces via [`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](23-lower_auto_vector_split.md) (pass 23). `ExpandMixedKernel` (pass 24) then folds both into the cross-core `tpush`/`tpop` machinery.

**Constraints** (enforced by the tensor-level deducer and the DSL parser, not this pass):

- **2D-only** — `UP_DOWN` / `LEFT_RIGHT` are only well-defined on the 2D physical tile view; an N-D operand is rejected with a `pl.reshape`-to-2D hint (an N-D tensor would flatten to `[product(leading), last]`, so a pre-flatten row split would not match the contiguous half the lowering physically takes).
- **Region-only** — the `tensor.*` form is reachable solely through the `pl.split_aiv` region (which supplies the split mode). The outlined low-level `pl.tile.aiv_shard(t, split=N)` form stays tile-only; a Tensor operand there is rejected.
- **Distributed rejected** — a `DistributedTensorType` operand is out of scope (AIV/AIC split only) and is rejected upstream.

**Conversion details:**

- **Split-kwarg forwarding.** The `split` int attr (`1` = `UP_DOWN`/axis0, `2` = `LEFT_RIGHT`/axis1, the tpush/tpop encoding) is passed through verbatim to the tile op, which halves (shard) or doubles (gather) the split-axis extent.
- **Boundary memory.** The tile-level split deducer intentionally leaves the boundary memory space null (the deduction fixpoint must not inherit an input-side layout); `OpRegistry::Create` then fills it from the tile op's `set_output_memory` declaration, so this converter needs no re-attachment of its own. `LowerAutoVectorSplit` builds its `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` through the same `Create`, which is what keeps the two paths byte-identical — one declaration, read once. That space is the **consuming lane's**: `tile.aiv_shard` → `Vec` (AIV pops the half into UB), `tile.aic_gather` → `Mat` (AIC pops the full tile into L1, the space `ExpandMixedKernel` builds its V→C tpop in). The operand side is the mirror — `Acc` for the shard, `Vec` for the gather — and is enforced by the `AivSplitValid` verifier rather than declared as an input constraint, because a violated input constraint would make `InferTileMemorySpace` *insert a move* to the required space instead of reporting the authoring error.
- **No synthesized load.** The realistic (region-only) operand is already an on-chip tile by the time the converter runs (its producer — a cube matmul for `aiv_shard`, a Vec vector op for `aic_gather` — lowered earlier in this same pass), so no `tile.load` is injected; `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` **are** the cross-core transfer.

**Recognized before this pass.** Because the `tensor.*` form survives from `OutlineIncoreScopes` until this pass runs, earlier stages already treat it as the AIV-split boundary: `ClassifyCallAffinity` rolls both `tensor.*` and `tile.*` shard/gather up as `MIXED` (so cube/vector outlining splits correctly), and `SplitAivStructuralVerifier` requires both forms to be region-scoped.

## Example

**Before**:

```python
@pl.program
class Before:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def main_incore_0(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.add(x, x)
        return y

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = self.main_incore_0(x)
        return y
```

**After**:

```python
@pl.program
class After:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def main_incore_0(
        self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32],
        ret0_out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]
    ) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        x_tile: pl.Tile[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.load(x, (0,), (64,))
        y_tile: pl.Tile[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.tile.add(x_tile, x_tile)
        ret0_store: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.store(y_tile, (0,), ret0_out)
        return ret0_store

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        ret0_out: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = pl.tensor.create((64,), dtype=pl.FP32)
        y: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32] = self.main_incore_0(x, ret0_out)
        return y
```

Key changes:

- `pl.add(x, x)` → `pl.tile.add(x_tile, x_tile)` (op conversion)
- `tile.load` inserted at entry, `tile.store` at exit
- `Out` parameter `ret0_out` added to InCore function
- `tensor.create` inserted at orchestration call site

## Loop-Carry Valid-Shape Repair

`tensor.matmul` drops its operands' `valid_shape`, so an accumulator only becomes narrower
than the seed it is carried from once this pass produces a `tile.matmul` over a
row-narrowed left operand:

```python
acc = pl.create_tensor([M, N], dtype=pl.INT32)          # full box
for k0 in pl.pipeline(0, K, K_TILE, stage=2):
    xk = pl.slice(x, [M, K_TILE], [m0, k0], valid_shape=[v, K_TILE])   # runtime v
    acc = pl.matmul_acc(acc, xk, wk, b_trans=True)      # narrowed, compact result
```

The carry is typed from its **init value alone** — `ConvertToSSA` mints the `IterArg` from
the seed, this pass re-mints it from the converted seed, and both force the loop's
`return_var` back to that type — so the narrowing dies at the loop boundary. `mad` writes
L0C at an N-fractal stride of `ceil(v/16)*16` while a reader that believes the full box
height walks it at the physical row pitch, corrupting every N-fractal above the first
(issue #2470).

Before returning, this pass therefore calls `narrow_loop_carry::NarrowAccCarries` on each
function: an Acc carry seeded by `tile.create` is re-declared at the extent its yields
prove — `tile.create(compact=True)` plus `tile.set_validshape` — and the body's def-use
closure is re-typed through the operators' own deducers. Repairing it in the pass that
creates it keeps the pipeline verifiable; leaving it would publish a carry the `TypeCheck`
diagnostic and the `AccCompactValid` property verifier reject. `FlattenTileNdTo2D` calls
the same helper, for an ND seed whose narrowing only appears when `tile.batch_matmul` is
unrolled into 2D matmuls.

A carry is left exactly as it is when the two readings of its buffer cannot disagree — a
single-fractal-block `[16, N]` accumulator packs to its physical rows whatever its valid
rows — or when the narrowed extent is only computed inside the loop body, where the
re-declared seed could not name it.

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/convert_tensor_to_tile_ops_pass.cpp`

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_convert_tensor_to_tile_ops.py`, `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_narrow_loop_carry_valid_shape.py` (the carry repair)

## Pass Properties

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Required | SSAForm, SplitIncoreOrch, NormalizedStmtStructure |
| Produced | SSAForm, IncoreTileOps, NormalizedStmtStructure, AivSplitValid |
| Invalidated | AivSplitValid |

`AivSplitValid` is both invalidated and re-produced, which forces a second verification of the split regions here. `OutlineIncoreScopes` establishes the property while the AIV-split boundary is still `tensor.aiv_shard` / `tensor.aic_gather`; a TensorType carries no memory space, so the verifier's boundary memory-contract check is necessarily skipped there. This pass rewrites those ops to their tile form and attaches the declared boundary memory, which is exactly what that check inspects.

## Key Components

| Component | Role |
| --------- | ---- |
| `TensorArgsInConvertedOpsCollector` | IRVisitor — identifies tensor params needing entry loads |
| `ConsumerSpaceCollector` | IRVisitor — collects each variable's consumer-demanded memory space from `input_reqs` |
| `TypePropagatingMutator` | Base IRMutator — propagates type changes through control flow |
| `TensorToTileMutator` | IRMutator — converts tensor ops to tile ops via OpConversionRegistry |
| `ForwardedCallFinder` | IRVisitor — locates the wrapper's call into a transformed InCore (Phase 2a) |
| `WrapperForwardMutator` | IRMutator — appends new Out args to the wrapper's inner call (Phase 2a) |
| `CallSiteUpdateMutator` | IRMutator — inserts tensor.create at orchestration call sites (Phase 2b) |
| `IncoreTileOpsVerifier` | IRVisitor — verifies no TensorType ops remain in InCore functions |

## Scope

| Function type | Action |
| ------------- | ------ |
| InCore | Converted (tensor ops → tile ops); Phase 1 may append `Out` params |
| Spmd / Group (forwarding to a transformed InCore) | Signature mirrors the InCore's new `Out` params; inner call forwards them (Phase 2a) |
| Spmd / Group (no transformed-InCore forwarding) | Unchanged |
| Orchestration / Opaque | Call sites updated — `tensor.create` inserted for each new `Out` param (Phase 2b) |
