# CanonicalizeTileSlice Pass

Lowers a `tile.slice` into the canonical `tile.extract` form so that movement is unified on `pto.textract` — Mat-resident slices (folded into matmul / `tile.extract` consumers), Vec slices whose lazy materialization would corrupt their source (materialized for the `tile.col_expand_*` family, issues #1640 and #2010), and unaligned Vec subviews (issue #1789).

## Overview

A `tile.slice` whose result tile is `Mem.Mat` is a legal high-level "sub-window of a Mat tile" construct. [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](15-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) emits one per batch page when it unrolls a `tile.batch_matmul`: the page offset is `batch_index * page_rows`, and for a leading-dim-1 batch that offset is 0 and the window covers the whole tile — but it is still a `tile.slice`.

PTO ISA supports `pto.subview` on Mat as a zero-copy alias (no data movement), so a standalone Mat slice is valid when its consumer accepts the subview SSA directly. However, consumers that trigger lazy materialization (via `MaterializeSubviewOperandIfNeeded`) would attempt a `loc=mat → loc=mat` `pto.textract` — an unsupported L1→L1 DMA path on targets such as Ascend 910C. This pass eliminates Mat-resident `tile.slice` nodes whose consumers it can canonicalize (extract/matmul) by folding the offset into each consumer for efficiency, then drops the now-dead slice. A Mat slice with a consumer that is not canonicalized (e.g. `tile.move`) is left intact — it lowers to a valid `pto.subview`.

The pass also canonicalizes a **Vec** `tile.slice` consumed by the `tile.col_expand_*` family (issues #1640, #2010). Those ops cannot read a `pto.subview` operand, so codegen lazily materializes the slice via `pto.textract` into the slice's own result buffer — and because `tile.slice` inherits its source's memory, that buffer sits **inside the still-live source**. The extract therefore runs in place over its own input, which is only safe when it is an **identity copy**. Two conditions must hold:

| Condition | Why it can fail |
| --------- | --------------- |
| The destination **address** is right | `AllocateMemoryAddr` folds a `ConstInt` offset into `base + off`, but a **dynamic** offset cannot be encoded as a `ConstInt` address and falls back to the bare source base — the extracted window lands on the source's row 0 (#1640). |
| The destination **layout** matches | The slice's buffer is dense (row pitch = slice cols) while the source window is strided (row pitch = source cols). These coincide only for a **contiguous** window: a single row, or one spanning every column. A column slice of a multi-row tile (`t[:, a:b]`) repacks strided → dense on top of its own source and destroys it — only row 0 survives, because its dense destination happens to equal its source address (#2010). |

When either condition fails, the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(..., target_memory=Vec)`, whose result gets its own non-inherited allocation. `tile.extract` is registered `not_inplace_safe()`, so [`MemoryReuse`](37-memory_reuse.md) cannot place that fresh buffer back onto the source either. A slice whose materialization *is* an identity copy is left untouched, so it keeps sharing the source buffer rather than paying for a duplicate allocation.

Independently, PTO vector instructions require tile operand base addresses to be 32-byte aligned. A zero-copy Vec slice starts at

```text
base + (off_row * base_cols + off_col) * storage_bits
```

so an FP32 column slice at `[:, 1:2]` starts only 4 bytes past an aligned allocation. Feeding that subview directly to an ordinary vector op such as `tile.muls` can hang the device (#1789). The pass therefore replaces an unaligned Vec slice operand with a fresh `tile.extract(..., target_memory=Vec)`. The new allocation is aligned; provably aligned slices remain zero-copy. Dynamic offsets are also kept zero-copy when scalar SSA arithmetic proves that their known multiple produces a 32-byte-aligned row or column displacement.

Both Vec materializations place the `tile.extract` **at the slice's definition** whenever that is provably equivalent, so the copy stays where the author wrote the slice — in particular inside the same `pl.split_aiv` region — and a slice with several consumers is copied once. A slice is a view that reads its source when consumed, so a copy taken at the definition is equivalent only when nothing writes that storage in between; when a write may reach it, the extract is placed before each consumer instead (see [Where a Vec extract goes](#where-a-vec-extract-goes)).

**Pipeline position**: After [`AutoTileMatmulL0`](19-auto_tile_matmul_l0.md) (so the per-iter `tile.extract`s that read the batch-page slices already exist), before [`InferTileMemorySpace`](21-infer_tile_memory_space.md).

**Requirements**: `SSAForm`, `SplitIncoreOrch`, `IncoreTileOps`, `TileOps2D`, `NormalizedStmtStructure`.

**Produces**: same as required (property-preserving rewrite).

**Invalidates**: nothing.

**When to use**: Always, as part of the default tile-stage pipeline. The pass is a no-op when no canonical `tile.slice` exists.

## Algorithm

For each InCore-typed function, in four steps:

1. **Collect** — index every `AssignStmt` whose value is a `tile.slice(src, shape, offset)` in canonical 3-argument form. A slice whose `src` is itself a recorded slice is peeled, accumulating the offset, so each entry resolves to a non-slice base tile plus a total `(off_row, off_col)`. Direct `ConstInt` SSA definitions and their plain aliases are resolved before this analysis, so a literal offset does not become artificially dynamic after `ConvertToSSA`. Scalar SSA definitions are also retained for modular alignment proofs: for example, `block_idx * 32` is dynamic but has a statically known 32-element multiple. Slices carrying `valid_shape` / `drop_dims` (4–5 arguments) are not plain windows and are skipped.

2. **Plan definition-site extracts** (Vec slices only) — a slice is materialized by replacing its own definition with `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Vec)` when both hold:
   - some consumer would materialize it under the consumer rules below (a `tile.col_expand_*` operand with a non-identity lazy textract, or an ordinary call operand, alias, loop initializer, or yield whose address is not provably aligned); and
   - nothing in the function may write its storage. Storage sharing is an equivalence class built with union-find over plain aliases, outputs that inherit a source buffer (views and in-place ops, read from the registry), and loop / if merges. A write is a declared writeback operand (`set_output_reuses_input`), a declared scratch or absolute-indexed destination (`set_lane_invariant_arg`), or any operand of an unregistered call.

   Every later reference to the slice then reads the extract, so the consumer rules below no longer match it. Slices are planned in program order: a chained slice of a planned slice is rebased onto the extract (base = the extract, offsets restart from the chained slice's own), since the extract is a fresh, dense buffer — its alignment is recomputed against that buffer, not the original root.

3. **Rewrite consumers** — for each remaining slice:
   - **`tile.extract(slice, ir, ic, shape)`** → `tile.extract(base, ir + off_row, ic + off_col, shape)`. The extract reads the slice's source directly; the index add is constant-folded when both terms are `ConstInt`.
   - **`tile.matmul` / `tile.matmul_acc` / `tile.matmul_bias` operand** (Mat slices only) → the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Left|Right)` — `Left` for the lhs operand, `Right` for the rhs. (The `tile.matmul_acc` accumulator operand is `Acc`-resident and never a Mat slice, so it is not rewritten here; it is instead checked for L0C contiguity — see [Acc accumulator windows](#acc-accumulator-windows).)
   - **`tile.col_expand_*` operand** (Vec slices only) → when the lazy `pto.textract` would not be an identity copy — a dynamic offset, or a window that is not contiguous in the base tile (more than one row *and* narrower than the base) — the operand is replaced by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Vec)`. Both operands are checked. Contiguous const-offset windows are left untouched.
   - **Ordinary call operand** (Vec slices only, in either an `AssignStmt` or an `EvalStmt`) → compute `(base_byte_offset * 8 + (off_row * base_cols + off_col) * storage_bits) mod 256`. A known concrete MemRef byte offset is included before the modulo calculation; the allocation-planning sentinel is treated as an aligned root, while a non-constant base offset is not statically provable. Scalar SSA definitions are followed through aliases, addition/subtraction, and multiplication to prove aligned dynamic multiples. If the result is nonzero or cannot be proved, replace the operand by a fresh `tile.extract(base, off_row, off_col, slice_shape, target_memory=Vec)`. `tile.slice` itself is skipped so chained views can be peeled, and `tile.extract` uses the direct folding rule above.
   - **SSA escape** (Vec slices only) → an unaligned slice assigned through a plain alias is materialized at the alias definition. An unaligned loop initializer is materialized before the loop and substituted through its `IterArg`; an unaligned value carried by `yield` is materialized before the yield. This prevents aliases and loop-carried identities from bypassing the ordinary-call lookup.

   The Vec consumer rules apply only to a slice step 2 did not plan — one whose storage may be written between the definition and the consumer. There, only a copy placed at the consumer reads what the view would have read.

4. **Drop dead slices** — a `tile.slice` whose result no longer has any use is removed. A chained slice only becomes dead once the slice consuming it is dropped, so this iterates to a fixpoint (bounded by the slice count). A slice still used at the end had a consumer this pass does not canonicalize; it is left intact — no regression versus the pre-pass IR.

The pass is a `FunctionPass`; functions are returned unchanged when no canonical `tile.slice` is present.

## Examples

### Slice folded into `tile.extract`

The offset-0 full-shape slice [`FlattenTileNdTo2D`](15-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md) emits for a leading-dim-1 batch operand:

**Before**:

```python
lhs_slice: pl.Tile[[32, 512], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(x_mat, [32, 512], [0, 0])
a:         pl.Tile[[32, 256], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Left] = pl.tile.extract(
    lhs_slice, 0, ko, shape=[32, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
```

**After** (slice dropped; extract reads the loaded Mat tile directly):

```python
a: pl.Tile[[32, 256], pl.INT8, pl.Mem.Left] = pl.tile.extract(
    x_mat, 0, ko, shape=[32, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
```

A non-zero page offset folds into the extract index — e.g. a slice at `[32, 0]` turns `extract(slice, 0, ko, ...)` into `extract(x_mat, 32, ko, ...)`.

### Slice folded into a `tile.matmul` operand

When `AutoTileMatmulL0` leaves a matmul untiled (already L0-sized), its Mat-slice operands are converted directly:

**Before**:

```python
lhs_slice: pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(lhs_mat, [16, 256], [0, 0])
rhs_slice: pl.Tile[[256, 64], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Mat] = pl.tile.slice(rhs_mat, [256, 64], [0, 0])
c:         pl.Tile[[16, 64],  pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Acc] = pl.tile.matmul(lhs_slice, rhs_slice)
```

**After**:

```python
lhs_left:  pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Left]  = pl.tile.extract(
    lhs_mat, 0, 0, shape=[16, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Left)
rhs_right: pl.Tile[[256, 64], pl.BF16, pl.Mem.Right] = pl.tile.extract(
    rhs_mat, 0, 0, shape=[256, 64], target_memory=pl.Mem.Right)
c:         pl.Tile[[16, 64],  pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Acc]   = pl.tile.matmul(lhs_left, rhs_right)
```

### Vec slice materialized into a `tile.col_expand_mul` operand (#1640)

A dynamic-offset slice of a local tile feeding `col_expand_mul` (the same rewrite applies to `col_expand_add`):

**Before**:

```python
row:    pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(local, [1, 256], [row_off, 0])
scaled: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(row, gamma_t)
```

**After** (slice dropped; the operand is materialized into a fresh, non-aliasing tile):

```python
row_ext: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    local, row_off, 0, shape=[1, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled:  pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(row_ext, gamma_t)
```

### Column slice of a multi-row Vec tile (#2010)

`t[:, 64:128]` on a `[16, 128]` tile is a *static*-offset slice, but its window is not contiguous — 16 rows, 64 of the source's 128 columns — so it is materialized too:

**Before**:

```python
hi:     pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(t, [16, 64], [0, 64])
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(hi, gamma_t)
```

**After**:

```python
hi_ext: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    t, 0, 64, shape=[16, 64], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 64], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(hi_ext, gamma_t)
```

Without the rewrite, `hi` allocates a dense `[16, 64]` buffer at `t + 256 B` — inside `t` — and the lazy `pto.textract` repacks `t`'s strided columns into it, overwriting `t` as it reads it. Only row 0 comes back correct, which is why the same construct is harmless on a single-row tile.

### Unaligned Vec column slice (#1789)

Column 1 of an FP32 tile begins four bytes past its aligned source allocation, so it cannot be used directly by `tile.muls`:

```python
head:   pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(local, [16, 1], [0, 1])
scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.muls(head, 0.5)
```

The pass gives the vector operation an aligned, independently allocated tile:

```python
head_ext: pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
    local, 0, 1, shape=[16, 1], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
scaled:   pl.Tile[[16, 1], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.muls(head_ext, 0.5)
```

By contrast, FP32 column 8 is 32 bytes from the source base and remains a zero-copy slice. A dynamic row offset also remains zero-copy when the source row stride is 32-byte aligned.

### Where a Vec extract goes

The extract replaces the slice's definition, so it stays in the `pl.split_aiv` region the author wrote it in. Here coefficient rows are read once for both lanes in a `NONE` region and consumed per lane in an `UP_DOWN` region:

**Before**:

```python
for lane in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):
    coeff: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(meta, [1, 256], [row_off, 0])
for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
    scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(local, coeff)
```

**After**:

```python
for lane in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):
    coeff_textract: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.extract(
        meta, row_off, 0, shape=[1, 256], target_memory=pl.Mem.Vec)
for aiv_id in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN):
    scaled: pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(local, coeff_textract)
```

Placing the extract at the consumer instead would move the read into the `UP_DOWN` region, where [`LowerAutoVectorSplit`](24-lower_auto_vector_split.md) sees a full-width vector op the author never wrote there.

If anything may write the source between the two sites, the view semantics win and the extract is placed at the consumer — after the write:

```python
row:    pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.slice(local, [1, 256], [row_off, 0])
padded: pl.Tile[[16, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.fillpad_inplace(local, pad_value=0)
scaled: pl.Tile[[1, 256], pl.FP32, pl.Mem.Vec] = pl.tile.col_expand_mul(row, gamma_t)
# after: row is dropped and `row_ext = pl.tile.extract(local, row_off, 0, ...)` is inserted
# immediately before col_expand_mul, so it reads the padded rows.
```

The written-storage test is whole-function, not between the two sites, so it can only decline a definition-site placement, never admit a wrong one. A declined slice falls back to the consumer placement above, which can still cross a region boundary.

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

**Properties**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/pass_properties.h` (`kCanonicalizeTileSliceProperties`)

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_canonicalize_tile_slice.py`

## Acc accumulator windows

The pass also **rejects** one shape it cannot repair. L0C is NZ: block
`(r_b, c_b)` of an `[M, N]` tile sits at `(c_b * M/16 + r_b) * fractal`. A window
is therefore contiguous only when it spans the parent's full row extent, or lies
inside a single 16-column block. A row window of a multi-block-column `Acc` tile
is strided, and the MAD writes its destination compactly from a bare pointer with
no destination stride, so every block column past the first lands in the wrong
row tile — silently, with only the first 16 columns of each row tile correct.

Unlike the Vec cases above there is no repair available: an `Acc` window cannot be
copied out and back, because nothing in the memory graph points into `Acc`. So a
matmul accumulator operand that is a non-contiguous `Acc` window raises a
`ValueError` naming the working spelling, which differs only by the sliced axis —
pack the accumulator as `[rows, N * tiles]` and slice columns.

The check is scoped by the op registry's `set_output_reuses_input`, so it covers
`tile.matmul_acc` / `tile.gemv_acc` / `tile.matmul_mx_acc` without naming them. It
stays silent on anything it cannot prove: a symbolic extent, a non-`Acc` layout,
or a dynamic column offset it cannot show stays inside one block. It applies to
the accumulator whether the op is bound to a result (`acc = pl.tile.matmul_acc(...)`)
or written as a bare statement (`pl.tile.matmul_acc(...)`).

### Resolving the accumulator operand back to its window

The window an accumulator names is rarely the `tile.slice` result Var. Hoisting
the slice out of the K loop — the natural spelling, since the window does not
change per K step — makes the in-body operand a loop `IterArg`, a different Var
from the slice result; a shape-preserving `tile.reshape` is another SSA name for
the same bytes. So the pass records, for every Var, **which window that Var
names**, not merely "is this Var a slice", and the check looks the operand up in
that map.

A Var inherits another Var's window along these *identity-preserving* edges,
each recorded during the same single program-order sweep that collects the
slices:

| Edge | Recorded from |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `v = tile.slice(src, shape, offset)` | The window itself (seed); chained slices are peeled, offsets accumulated |
| `v = w` (plain SSA alias) | `w`'s window |
| `v = <op>(src, ...)` where the op's output lands in a source operand's storage | The source operand's window. The relation is a registry read (`OutputMemoryInheritsInput() && IsInplaceSafe()`, or `set_output_reuses_input`), never an op list — so `tile.reshape` / `tile.set_validshape` and a chained `tile.matmul_acc` are covered, while `tile.transpose` and `tile.extract` (fresh buffers) are excluded |
| Loop `IterArg` | Its **initializer's** window (`ForStmt` / `WhileStmt`) |
| `ForStmt` / `WhileStmt` `return_vars_[i]` | The window the trailing `pl.yield_` names for `iter_args_[i]` — **only when that is the same window the initializer names**, which is the canonical carry. A zero-trip loop returns the initializer instead, so binding a different window would claim one that a path does not name |
| `IfStmt::return_vars_[i]` | The window both arms yield, when they provably yield the *same* one (same parent Var, equal offsets) |

An edge is recorded **only when both ends provably describe the same window
extent** — same rank, same dtype, and every dimension a compile-time constant of
the same value. Landing in the source's storage says the two Vars name the same
*bytes*; the extent test says the shape the check reads off the operand's own
`TileType` is still the extent those bytes form. Together they are a proof, and
anything unproven is left unrecorded — which reproduces the previous silence
rather than guessing:

- a **shape-changing** `tile.reshape` fails the test, so a reshaped extent is
  never compared against the parent's rows;
- `tile.reinterpret_view` fails it on dtype — the 16-column-block arithmetic
  assumes a 4-byte accumulator element;
- `tile.transpose_view` swaps the trailing two extents, so it fails it for every
  non-square window. A *square* window passes and is harmless: the transposed
  view spans the identical bytes with identical row and column extents, so both
  accept rules reach the same verdict as for the untransposed window;
- a symbolic extent fails it, matching the check's own refusal to reason about
  symbolic shapes.

Memory space is deliberately not compared: the verdict comes from the *parent*
tile's space and the operand's extents, never from the operand's own space — and
the tile view ops legitimately deduce a result type that leaves it unset for
`InferTileMemorySpace` to fill in later.

#### The loop back edge is checked, not recorded

A carried accumulator names two windows: the initializer's on iteration 0, and
whatever the body's trailing `pl.yield_` names on every iteration after. A Var
cannot be recorded as naming two windows, and recording either one would make the
other iteration's destination invisible — so the yielded window is **checked**
against the same rule instead, with the destination extent taken from the
`IterArg` (the type the loop gives the carry).

Three conditions keep that from over-rejecting:

- it fires only for carries the body actually uses as an accumulator
  **destination**, so a carry the body merely reads is never rejected for a shape
  no MAD writes;
- it fires only when the loop **provably runs more than once** — constant
  `start` / `stop` / `step` with `start + step < stop`. A single-trip loop never
  takes its back edge; a symbolic trip count and every `while` count as
  unprovable and stay silent;
- it is a check, never a binding, so the map stays acyclic. No fixpoint is
  needed and the sweep stays one forward pass.

The canonical carry (`yield matmul_acc(iter_arg, ...)`) resolves straight back to
the initializer's window, so this re-reaches the verdict the body already passed
and costs nothing on the shapes the pipeline generates.

**Known limits — all of them silent, never a false rejection:**

- **An unprovable trip count leaves the back edge unchecked.** A symbolic loop
  bound or a `while` cannot be shown to take the back edge, so a carry whose
  yield names a worse window than its initializer goes unchecked there.
- **An if-merge whose arms name *different* windows is not bound.** Binding
  either one would be a claim the other path contradicts — and this map also
  feeds the chained-slice offset arithmetic, so a wrong binding could move the
  verdict for an unrelated slice.
- **Interprocedural routes are out of reach.** This is a function pass, so a
  window arriving as an InCore function parameter carries no window information.

### The rejected window is not always in the kernel source

A compiler-generated window can reach this check with no `tile.slice` written
anywhere in the kernel, so the diagnostic must not assume the author can edit the
slice it names.

`FlattenTileNdTo2D` used to be the main source of such windows: it unrolled a
`tile.batch_matmul_acc` by stacking the accumulator's batch pages **along rows**
and slicing one page per batch (`acc_page_i = tile.slice(acc, [M, N], [i * M,
0])`), which is exactly the rejected shape for `N > 16`. That lowering is gone —
it now packs the pages **along columns** (`acc_page_i = tile.slice(acc, [M, N],
[0, i * N])`), the accepted full-row-extent shape, and rejects the shapes it
cannot pack with its own diagnostic naming the DSL workaround. See
[Batched accumulators pack along columns](15-flatten_tile_nd_to_2d.md#batched-accumulators-pack-along-columns).

The narrow row-packed form survives there for pages at most 16 columns wide,
which this pass whitelists as a single-block window, so a row window still
reaches this check — it is simply never one this pass rejects. The rejection
therefore stays as written: it is the backstop that would catch any future pass
re-introducing a strided accumulator destination, and narrowing it would let a
silent miscompute through.

This is a workaround for an upstream defect ([hw-native-sys/pto-isa#253](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pto-isa/issues/253)),
not a property of the DSL — `TMATMUL_ACC_IMPL` forwards the destination as a bare
`.data()` pointer and takes `m` from the left operand, so `TileRes::Rows` is never
read. If pto-isa gains a destination stride, this rejection should be relaxed or
deleted rather than kept.

| Vec `tile.slice` feeding an ordinary call, inherited address provably 32-byte aligned | Untouched; keeps the zero-copy subview |
| Vec `tile.slice` that one of the Vec rows above materializes, storage never written in the function | The **definition** is replaced by the `tile.extract`; every consumer reads it (one copy, in the author's region) |
| Vec `tile.slice` that one of the Vec rows above materializes, storage possibly written in the function | The extract is inserted before **each consumer**; slice dropped |
| Chained Mat `tile.slice` (slice of a slice) | Peeled; offsets accumulated |
| `tile.slice` with `valid_shape` / `drop_dims` | Skipped (not a plain window). If such a slice *also* fails either identity-copy condition above — a dynamic offset (e.g. a rank-reducing `t[i]`) or a non-contiguous window — while feeding a col-expand op, codegen rejects it with an `INTERNAL_CHECK` rather than emitting the source-corrupting materialization. The Acc accumulator check above still applies to such a slice: it needs only the physical base and offset, which are recorded for every window regardless of canonicalization eligibility |
| `Acc`-resident `tile.slice` used as a matmul **accumulator**, window neither spanning the parent's full row extent nor inside one 16-column block | **Rejected** with a `ValueError` naming the column-slice spelling — the MAD has no destination stride, so the write would silently land in the wrong row tile (pto-isa#253). The operand does not have to *be* the slice: a loop `IterArg` carrying it, a plain SSA alias, or a shape-preserving view / in-place op over it resolves back to the same window (see "Resolving the accumulator operand back to its window") |
| Other Left/Right/Acc-resident `tile.slice`, including a *contiguous* Acc accumulator window | Untouched (no matching consumer) |
| Functions with no canonical `tile.slice` | Returned unchanged |
