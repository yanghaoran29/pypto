# Functions and Programs

How a Python function becomes an IR function, which decorator to reach for, and how
functions call each other.

> **Prerequisites:** [Types](00-types.md).

## Concept

A decorator does not wrap your function — it **parses its source**. The body never
executes as Python. That single fact explains most of what follows: why closure variables
behave the way they do, why `pl.yield_` is meaningful only inside one, and why an error in a kernel body is reported at parse time with a line number
rather than at call time with a traceback.

**`@pl.jit` is how you write PyPTO kernels.** Types come from the arguments at the first
call, the function specializes, and sub-functions are discovered automatically — you call
them by name and the decorator finds them. It is what `examples/` uses and what the rest
of this manual uses.

You will also meet `@pl.function` inside `@pl.program`: a class where each method is one
IR function and calls between them are written `self.other(...)`. That form is a
one-to-one transcription of the IR, and it exists mainly for writing compiler test cases,
where a test needs to state a program's exact shape without ever running it. As a user you
do not need it — [the section below](#plfunction-and-plprogram) is there for when you
read a compiler test or a piece of printed IR.

## Quickstart: an entry point and a device kernel

```python
import pypto.language as pl

@pl.jit.incore
def add_kernel(
    a: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
    b: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]],
):
    out[:] = pl.add(a, b)
    return out

@pl.jit
def entry(
    a: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
    b: pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32],
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[128, 128], pl.FP32]],
):
    out = add_kernel(a, b, out)      # sub-function discovered automatically
    return out
```

| Line | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `@pl.jit.incore` | Marks a device kernel — the execution plane, where operators live |
| `@pl.jit` | Marks the chip-level entry point — the control plane, which dispatches |
| `add_kernel(a, b, out)` | A plain call; the decorator discovers the callee and wires it in |
| `out: pl.Out[...]` | Declares the direction, which is how the compiler orders this task |

To read the IR this becomes, call `entry.lower(*args)` for the post-pass `ir.Program`, or
`entry.compile(*args)` and print `compiled.program.as_python()`.

## Mechanics

### The `@pl.jit` family

Five variants, one per IR function kind, so a single program can span host, chip, and
core levels:

| Decorator | IR target | Use for |
| --------- | --------- | ------- |
| `@pl.jit` | `Orchestration` | Chip-level entry point that dispatches InCore work |
| `@pl.jit.host` | `level=HOST, role=Orchestrator` | HOST entry — allocates window buffers, dispatches chip orchestrators per rank |
| `@pl.jit.incore` | `InCore` | A device kernel (accepts `level=` to target a specific hierarchy level) |
| `@pl.jit.inline` | `Inline` | Helper spliced into every call site by `InlineFunctions` |
| `@pl.jit.opaque` | `Opaque` | A separate IR function that may hold orchestration loops and `pl.at` scopes |
| `@pl.jit.graph` | `Graph` | A recordable orchestration fragment — the `host_build_graph` runtime records its task topology on the first call and replays it after, so N calls cost one graph build rather than N. Requires compiling under `RuntimeKind.HOST_BUILD_GRAPH` |

`@pl.jit.graph` has a scope form: `with pl.graph("name"):` marks a region *in place*
instead of splitting it into a function. The two compile to the same thing — the region is
outlined into a Graph function named after `name` — so the choice is ergonomic. Use the
decorator when the layer is already its own function; use the scope when the region is a
slice of a larger orchestration body you would rather not split up:

```python
@pl.jit
def decode(w: pl.Tensor, hidden: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor]):
    for layer in pl.range(40):
        with pl.graph("decoder_layer"):        # recorded once, replayed 39 times
            ...
    return hidden
```

The name is required and becomes the recorded graph's identity, so keep it stable. A Graph
region cannot nest inside another Graph region, nor inside `pl.at` / `pl.cluster` /
`pl.spmd` — those become a single device task, whereas a Graph region records a topology of
them. All three are compile errors.

Sub-function dependencies (`.incore` / `.inline` / `.opaque` / `.graph`) are auto-discovered from
the entry's body — call them by name. The name you call is resolved in the entry's own
namespace, so an aliased import (`from kernels import matmul as mm`, or a plain
`mm = matmul` rebinding) is discovered like any other binding; the generated program still
names the function after its `def`. When two distinct sub-functions share that name — two
modules each defining `helper`, or two kernels from one factory — the second one generated
is suffixed (`helper`, `helper__2`), so both specializations survive; the entry keeps its
own name. A `@pl.jit.host` entry additionally discovers
`@pl.jit` chip-orchestration dependencies, so a full distributed program needs no
`@pl.program` class.

The fragment below shows only the discovery structure — the kernel bodies are elided, and
the distributed types it names are covered in the distributed chapter, which is not
written yet:

```python
import pypto.language.distributed as pld

@pl.jit.inline
def reduce_step(local, peer, out): ...

@pl.jit
def chip_orch(inp: pl.Tensor, out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor],
              data: pl.InOut[pld.DistributedTensor], peer: pl.Scalar[pl.INT32]):
    return reduce_step(inp, peer, out)      # auto-discovered sub-function

@pl.jit.host
def host_orch(
    inputs: pl.Tensor[[2, 1, 256], pl.FP32],
    outputs: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[2, 1, 256], pl.FP32]],
):
    data_buf = pld.alloc_window_buffer(256 * pl.FP32.get_byte())
    for r in pl.range(pld.world_size()):
        data = pld.window(data_buf, [1, 256], dtype=pl.FP32)
        chip_orch(inputs[r], outputs[r], data, (r + 1) % pld.world_size(), device=r)
    return outputs
```

Plain `@pl.jit` entries do **not** discover other `@pl.jit` entries — only `.host`
reaches across the chip boundary. That keeps two unrelated top-level kernels from
silently folding into one program.

`@pl.jit.host` rejects `level=` (HOST is implicit).

### What a sub-function hands back keeps its shape and dtype

Specialization stamps every generated parameter with a concrete shape and dtype, so a
tensor a sub-function returns must be traceable to one. Both conventions work, and you can
mix them in the same entry:

```python
@pl.jit.inline
def make_pair(x: pl.Tensor[[1, 8], pl.FP32]):
    a = pl.create_tensor([1, 8], dtype=pl.FP32)   # helper allocates its own results
    b = pl.create_tensor([1, 8], dtype=pl.FP32)
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):
        a[:, :] = x[:, :]
        b[:, :] = pl.mul(x[:, :], 2.0)
    return a, b

@pl.jit.incore
def relu_kernel(x: pl.Tensor, out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor]):   # caller allocates, kernel fills
    ...

@pl.jit
def entry(x: pl.Tensor[[1, 8], pl.FP32], out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[1, 8], pl.FP32]]):
    a, b = make_pair(x)          # metas read out of make_pair's own body
    buf = pl.create_tensor([1, 8], dtype=pl.FP32)
    mid = relu_kernel(a, buf)    # mid aliases buf, so it inherits buf's meta
    ...
```

A device kernel (`@pl.jit.incore`) cannot allocate, so it always takes the second form —
`pl.create_tensor` belongs on the control plane. An `@pl.jit.inline` helper is spliced into
the caller, so either form is available to it.

An extent the specializer cannot compute statically is *not* by itself a problem. A
`pl.create_tensor` sized from a value only the device knows — `pl.tensor.read(cfg, [0])`,
`pld.world_size()` — becomes a dynamic dimension and keeps flowing, and the shared pass
pipeline judges whatever the program then does with it (loading the whole tensor as a tile,
say, gets you `InitMemRef requires static shape` — the same error the equivalent
`@pl.program` earns).

What does not resolve is a returned tensor whose shape the specializer cannot *reach* at
all: a `pl.reshape` whose target shape is not static (a reshape is constrained by its
source's element count, so no dynamic dimension can stand in for it), or a result rebound
through an operation the specializer does not model. That surfaces as
`missing inferred tensor metadata for parameter '<name>'` at the *next* call that consumes
it — the error names the consumer, but the fix belongs at the producer: give the producing
statement a statically inferable shape, or pass the buffer in as a `pl.Out[...]` parameter.

### Three constraints that decide whether a jit kernel compiles

These are the failures new `@pl.jit` code hits, in the order it hits them.

**1. A `@pl.jit` entry body cannot hold operators.** It is an Orchestration function —
the control plane. Put the operators inside `with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):`, or
move them into a `@pl.jit.incore` sub-function.

```python
@pl.jit
def bad(x: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32], out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32]]):
    out[:] = pl.add(x, x)        # ✗ Misplaced tensor op ... should be inside InCore block
    return out

@pl.jit
def good(x: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32], out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32]]):
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):
        out[:] = pl.add(x, x)    # ✓
    return out
```

**2. `JITFunction` has no `as_python()`.** The IR does not exist until a specialization
does. Call `lower(*args)` for the post-pass `ir.Program`, or `compile(*args)` and read
`compiled.program.as_python()` for the specialized, pre-pass IR.

**3. `compile()` takes the kernel's own arguments, not compile options.** Compile-time
knobs go through `config=RunConfig(...)`. A stray `compile(skip_ptoas=True)` is bound
against the kernel's signature and raises `TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument`.
`@pl.jit` detects whether `ptoas` is available on its own, so `skip_ptoas` is not something
you need to pass.

**A device kernel cannot return a scalar.** The runtime's two task-argument channels are
disjoint: scalars go *in* by value, and only tensors come back. So a value computed on
device and needed by the caller — the orchestration function that launched the kernel, and
the host beyond it — has to travel in a tensor. That covers a scalar tucked inside a
`pl.Tuple[...]` return, too.

```python
@pl.jit.incore
def bad(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Scalar[pl.INDEX]:   # ✗ no carrier for the return
    ...

@pl.jit.incore                                                  # ✓ hand it back in a [1] tensor
def good(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32], n_out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[1], pl.INT32]]):
    ...
# then, in the entry body, after the launch:
n = pl.tensor.read(n_out, [0])
```

The same rule applies to a scalar you assign *inside* `with pl.at(...)` and read after it —
that is a kernel return in disguise. When the value only depends on things the entry body
already has (a loop variable, a scalar parameter), the compiler moves the computation out
of the scope for you; when it depends on device data, it asks you to route it through a
tensor as above.

A helper that computes a scalar *for* the kernel is fine — write it `@pl.jit.inline`
(`FunctionType.Inline`). It is spliced at the call site, so it is not a task and the rule
does not apply to it.

### `@pl.function` and `@pl.program`

You reach for this form when writing a compiler test case, not when writing a kernel. It
describes the IR one-to-one: the class is the program, each method is a function, and the
call graph is written out rather than discovered. `@pl.jit` specializes into exactly this
shape — printing a compiled program shows you `@pl.program` source.

```python
@pl.program
class Adder:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def add_kernel(self, a, b, out): ...

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def entry(self, a, b, out):
        out = self.add_kernel(a, b, out)     # explicit cross-function call
        return out
```

Every method takes `self` (it is stripped from the IR), and `Adder` becomes an
`ir.Program` — not a Python class you can instantiate. `Adder.as_python()` prints it.

`type=` names the plane each function belongs to:

| Function type | Plane | Typical use |
| ------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `Opaque` (default) | none yet | Standalone building block; takes its plane from where it is used |
| `InCore` | Execution | Load / compute / store kernel |
| `Orchestration` | Control | Creates tensors, dispatches InCore tasks |
| `Inline` | none | Spliced at every call site; leaves no function behind |

A standalone `@pl.function` called from inside a `@pl.program` is added to the program as
a separate function. `@pl.inline` (and `@pl.jit.inline`) instead expand at the call site
and leave no function behind.

```python
@pl.inline
def normalize(x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
    return pl.mul(x, 2.0)
```

The decorated object is a `pl.InlineFunction` — a template the parser splices, not a
function you can call from Python.

### Function attributes: `pl.func_attr`

Metadata about the function as a whole is declared with `pl.func_attr({...})` as the
**first statement** of the body:

```python
@pl.program
class Kernels:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def kernel(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32], w: pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32],
               out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64, 64], pl.FP32]]):
        pl.func_attr({"stationary": w, "split": pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN})
        ...
```

It reads oddly for a *function*-level declaration to sit inside the body, so it is worth
saying why. A decorator is evaluated before the signature binds any name, so
`@pl.function(attrs={"stationary": w})` cannot be written at all — `w` does not exist
yet. Body position places the declaration after the parameters are bound, which is what
makes an attribute that *references a parameter* expressible. The alternatives are a
positional index (`{"stationary_param": 1}`, which breaks the moment a pass reorders
parameters) or a naming convention nothing enforces.

Rules worth knowing:

| Rule | Why |
| ---- | --- |
| Must precede every other statement | An attribute describes the whole function; it must not appear to start applying partway down a body. This also bounds what it can reference to the parameters. |
| A bare name is always a parameter | `pl.func_attr({"n": k})` records the parameter `k`, never a same-named Python variable from the enclosing scope. Write Python constants as literals. |
| Multiple calls merge | A key declared twice is an error naming the key, so which value wins is never a matter of parse order. |
| `auto_scope=` and `external_source=` stay on the decorator | The parser reads them *before* it walks the body, so a body-position declaration would arrive too late to take effect. |

`@pl.function(attrs={...})` is **deprecated** and emits a `DeprecationWarning`. It still
parses and behaves identically, but it can only ever carry values that reference nothing.
Printed IR always uses a non-deprecated spelling — the `pl.func_attr` prologue, or the
dedicated `auto_scope=` / `external_source=` keywords — so reparsing compiler output never
warns.

### Splitting compile from dispatch

`@pl.jit` kernels normally fuse specialize + compile + dispatch into one `kernel(*args)`
call. `JITFunction.compile(*sample_args)` stops after compilation and hands back the
`CompiledProgram` — for driving `ChipWorker` yourself, inspecting artifacts under
`compiled.output_dir`, or validating codegen ahead of time.

```python
compiled = my_kernel.compile(sample_x, sample_w, sample_out)
print("artifacts in:", compiled.output_dir)
```

The returned object is the same one the JIT cache holds, so a later call with the same
specialization key returns the identical instance.

`lower(*sample_args)` stops one stage earlier: it runs the passes and returns the
post-pass `ir.Program`, with no code generation, no `ptoas`, no artifacts, and no cache
write. Use it to read lowered IR; use `compile()` when codegen itself is what you want to
check. Both accept `config=RunConfig(...)`, but `lower()` ignores the runtime and artifact
fields. Compile options are in [Compiling](../execution/00-compile.md) and the runtime surface in
[Running](../execution/01-run.md).

`specialize(*sample_args)` stops one stage earlier still: entry and deps are specialized
into `@pl.program` source and parsed, and the **pre-pass** `ir.Program` comes back
untransformed. Reach for it only when something downstream runs the pass pipeline itself
— most of all `ir.compile(program, output_dir=...)`, which runs passes *and* code
generation, so handing it `lower()`'s output would run the pipeline twice.

```python
program = my_kernel.specialize(sample_x, sample_w, sample_out)
ir.compile(program, output_dir="build/out", backend_type=BackendType.Ascend910B)
```

It takes no `config=`: no pass runs here, so a `RunConfig` would have nothing to
configure. Sample arguments may be omitted only when every tensor parameter is annotated
with full shapes — a bare `pl.Tensor` has none to read.

> Two kernels that specialize to the same program compare equal **after** passes, not
> before: the specializer renames SSA-rebound locals (`out` becomes `out_v1`), and
> canonicalization removes the difference. Compare `lower()` output when asserting
> equivalence against a hand-written `@pl.program`.

Three accessors describe the signature without specializing anything: `param_names` (in
declaration order), `output_param_names` (the `pl.Out[...]` and `pl.InOut[...]` params,
also in declaration order), and `__name__`.

### External C++ kernels

A hand-written C++ kernel can be called like any other function. See
[Integrating Hand-Written C++ Kernels](../../dev/language/04-external-kernels.md).

## Edge Cases

> **Fatal pitfall:** verify a new `@pl.jit` example with a full `compile()`, never with
> `lower()` alone. `lower()` stops after the passes, so the "operators in an Orchestration
> body" error above never fires — the kernel appears to pass and fails only when someone
> runs it for real.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| **`Misplaced tensor op ... should be inside InCore block`** | Operators directly in a `@pl.jit` body | Wrap in `with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP):` or move to `@pl.jit.incore` |
| **`AttributeError: 'JITFunction' object has no attribute 'as_python'`** | Printing IR that does not exist yet | `f.lower(*args)`, or `f.compile(*args)` then `compiled.program.as_python()` |
| **`lower()` passes but `compile()` fails** | `lower()` runs no code generation | Expected — use `compile()` to check codegen |
| **`TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument`** | A compile option was passed to `compile()`, which binds against the kernel's signature | Pass `config=RunConfig(...)` |
| **A second top-level kernel is missing from the program** | Plain `@pl.jit` does not discover other `@pl.jit` entries | Use `@pl.jit.host`, or make the callee `.incore` / `.opaque` |
| **`auto_scope=False` rejected** | Used on `.incore` / `.opaque` | Put it on the entry or on an `.inline` helper |
| **`self` missing from a `@pl.program` method** | Every method needs it | Add `self`; it is stripped from the IR |
| **`A task cannot return a scalar`** | A device kernel declares a `pl.Scalar` return | Write it into a `[1]` tensor output and `pl.tensor.read(t, [0])` after the launch |
| **`cannot return a scalar` naming a variable in a scope** | A scalar assigned inside `pl.at(...)` is read after it, and depends on device data | Route it through a `[1]` tensor, or move the computation out of the scope |

## Worked example

`examples/utils/cross_function_calls.py` — `@pl.jit.inline` helpers auto-discovered as
deps of a `@pl.jit` entry and spliced at the call site.
