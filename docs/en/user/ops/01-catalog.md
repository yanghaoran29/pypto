# Catalog

Every operator family, one line each. Signatures live in the docstrings — see
[Operations](index.md) for why this page does not repeat them.

> **Reading the tables:** the **Reach** column gives the shortest spelling that works.
> `pl.` means the name is available unqualified; `pl.tile.` / `pl.tensor.` mean the
> operator is level-specific. Names marked **(t)** are tile-only operators re-exported at
> top level for convenience — `pl.load` *is* `pl.tile.load`, not a dispatcher.

## Creation

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `create_tensor` | `pl.` | Allocate a DDR tensor. `manual_dep=True` opts it out of dependency tracking for its lifetime |
| `create_tile` | `pl.` (t) | Allocate an on-chip buffer |
| `create_l1` | `pl.` (t) | Allocate in L1 explicitly |
| `full` | `pl.` | A tensor filled with a constant |
| `arange` | `pl.` | Consecutive integers (`tensor.ci`) |
| `random` | `pl.` | Random-filled tensor |
| `tri` | `pl.` (t) | Lower- or upper-triangular mask tile; `upper=` picks the side, `diagonal=` shifts it, and only the valid region is written |
| `const` | `pl.` | A literal with an explicit dtype — see [Directives](../language/05-directives.md#typed-constants) |
| `array.create` | `pl.array.` | Allocate an on-core array |

## Data movement

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `load` | `pl.` (t) | DDR → `Vec` (default) or `Mat`, via `target_memory=` |
| `store` | `pl.` (t) | On-chip → DDR |
| `move` | `pl.` (t) | On-chip → on-chip; the only path into `Left` / `Right` / `Bias` |
| `reserve_buffer` | `pl.` | Reserve a cross-core buffer |
| `import_peer_buffer` | `pl.` | Reference a peer core's buffer |

See [Memory and Data Movement](../language/03-memory.md) for which moves are legal.

## Elementwise arithmetic

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `add` `sub` `mul` `div` | `pl.` | Binary arithmetic; a Python number on the right selects the scalar-operand form |
| `neg` `abs` `recip` | `pl.` | Unary negate, absolute value, reciprocal |
| `rem` `rems` `fmod` `fmods` | `pl.` | Remainder and floating-point modulo, tensor and scalar forms |
| `addc` `subc` `addsc` `subsc` | `pl.` (t) | Three-input add / subtract with carry operand |
| `part_add` `part_mul` `part_max` `part_min` | `pl.` | Partial (segmented) arithmetic |

## Math

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `exp` `log` | `pl.` | Exponential, natural logarithm |
| `sqrt` `rsqrt` | `pl.` | Square root; reciprocal square root. `high_precision=` is tensor-only and **raises** on a Tile — at tile level precision is selected by passing the scratch tile to `pl.tile.rsqrt(src, tmp)` |
| `sin` `cos` | `pl.` | Trigonometric |

## Comparison and selection

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `cmp` `cmps` | `pl.` | Compare two operands / operand against a scalar |
| `maximum` `minimum` | `pl.` | Elementwise max / min of two operands |
| `maximums` `minimums` | `pl.` (t) | Elementwise max / min against a scalar |
| `max` `min` | `pl.` (t) | Scalar max / min of two values — **not** a tile reduction. To reduce a tile use `row_max` / `col_max` (and the `min` forms) |
| `sel` `sels` | `pl.` (t) | Select by mask, tensor and scalar forms |

## Activations

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |

| `prelu` `lrelu` | `pl.` (t) | Parametric / leaky rectified linear |

## Bitwise

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `and_` `or_` `xor` `not_` | `pl.` | Bitwise logic |
| `ands` `ors` `xors` | `pl.` | Bitwise logic against a scalar |
| `shl` `shr` | `pl.` | Shift left / right |
| `shls` `shrs` | `pl.` | Shift by a scalar amount |

## Reductions

Row reductions collapse the last axis; column reductions collapse the first.

| Operator | Reach | What it does |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `row_sum` `row_prod` `row_max` `row_min` | `pl.` | Reduce along a row |
| `col_sum` `col_prod` `col_max` `col_min` | `pl.` | Reduce along a column |
| `row_argmax` `row_argmin` | `pl.` | Index of the row extremum |
| `col_argmax` `col_argmin` | `pl.` | Index of the column extremum |

Several reductions accept a `tmp_tile` argument. Passing one changes the reduction
strategy (binary tree versus sequential), which changes floating-point association — the
results differ within tolerance rather than being wrong. Reductions over a partially valid
tile depend on the pad value; see
[Memory § valid shape](../language/03-memory.md#valid-shape-and-padding).

## Broadcast and expand

| `col_expand_add` `col_expand_sub` `col_expand_mul` | `pl.` | Column-wise equivalents |
| `col_expand_div` `col_expand_max` `col_expand_min` | `pl.` | Column-wise division, max, and min |
| `row_expand_expdif` `col_expand_expdif` | `pl.` | Broadcast fused with `exp(x - m)` — the softmax kernel |
| `expand_clone` `expands` | `pl.` | Broadcast a value across a shape |
| `fillpad` `fillpad_expand` | `pl.` | Fill the invalid region; optionally broadcast in the same step |

| `reinterpret_view` | `pl.` | Reinterpret without moving data |
| `set_validshape` | `pl.` | Declare the meaningful region of a tile |
| `cast` | `pl.` | Convert dtype — may expand to a multi-hop chain, see [LegalizeTileCast](../../dev/passes/15-legalize_tile_cast.md) |

| `gemv` `gemv_acc` `gemv_bias` | `pl.` (t) | Matrix-vector forms |
| `matmul_mx` `matmul_mx_acc` `matmul_mx_bias` | `pl.` (t) | MX block-scale multiply — each operand is an FP8E4M3FN data tile plus an FP8E8M0 scale tile |

| `tpush_to_aiv` `tpush_to_aic` | `pl.` | Push a tile to the peer core |
