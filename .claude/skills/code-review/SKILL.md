# PyPTO Code Review Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive code review guidelines for the PyPTO project, checking code quality, documentation alignment, and cross-layer consistency.

## How to Use

When you need to perform a code review:

1. Read the agent instructions at `.claude/agents/code-review/AGENT.md`
2. Invoke the Task tool with `subagent_type="generalPurpose"` and include the agent instructions
3. The agent will analyze changes and provide feedback using the guidelines below

## Review Process

1. **Get changes**: Run `git diff` to see all staged and unstaged changes
2. **Analyze each file** against the review checklist below
3. **Check documentation alignment**: Ensure docs match code changes
4. **Verify cross-layer consistency**: Check C++, Python bindings, and type stubs
5. **Report findings**: Provide clear, actionable feedback

## Review Checklist

### 1. Code Quality

- [ ] Follows project style and conventions
- [ ] No debug code or commented sections
- [ ] No TODOs/FIXMEs unless documented
- [ ] Proper use of `CHECK` vs `INTERNAL_CHECK`
- [ ] PyPTO exceptions (not C++ exceptions)
- [ ] Clear, descriptive names
- [ ] Appropriate comments for complex logic
- [ ] Linter errors fixed (not suppressed)

### 2. Python Style (see `python-style.md` for full details)

- [ ] `@overload` used for functions with multiple distinct call signatures (not `Union`)
- [ ] Modern type syntax: `list[int]`, `dict[str, Any]` (not `List`, `Dict`)
- [ ] f-strings for all string formatting (no `.format()` or `%`)
- [ ] Google-style docstrings (Args/Returns/Raises)
- [ ] Type hints on all public API parameters and return types

### 3. Documentation Alignment

- [ ] Documentation reflects code changes
- [ ] Examples in docs still work
- [ ] Documentation files ≤300 lines (split if >600 lines)
- [ ] AI rules/skills/agents ≤150 lines
- [ ] C++ implementation matches Python bindings
- [ ] Type stubs (`.pyi`) match actual API
- [ ] Docstrings complete and accurate
- [ ] Referenced files still exist

**See [documentation-length.md](./.claude/rules/documentation-length.md) for length guidelines**

### 4. Commit Content

- [ ] Only relevant changes included
- [ ] No build artifacts (`build/`, `*.o`, `*.so`)
- [ ] No sensitive information (tokens, keys)
- [ ] No temporary test files
- [ ] Changes are cohesive and related

## Cross-Layer Consistency

When APIs change, all three layers must be updated together. See [cross-layer-sync.md](../../rules/cross-layer-sync.md) for examples and naming conventions.

**Quick check:**
- [ ] C++ headers (`include/pypto/`)
- [ ] Python bindings (`python/bindings/`) — snake_case method names
- [ ] Type stubs (`python/pypto/pypto_core/`) — signatures match, `@overload` where needed

## Common Issues to Flag

- **Debug code**: `std::cout << "DEBUG"`, `print()` left in, `// TODO: fix later`
- **Wrong error macro**: `CHECK` for internal invariants (use `INTERNAL_CHECK`), or vice versa
- **C++ exceptions**: `throw std::runtime_error(...)` instead of `pypto::ValueError`
- **Missing bindings**: C++ method added but no Python binding or type stub
- **`Union` instead of `@overload`**: Function with distinct call patterns uses `Union` args
- **Legacy type syntax**: `List[int]`, `Dict[str, Any]` instead of `list[int]`, `dict[str, Any]`
- **Outdated docs**: API changed but documentation shows old usage
- **Build artifacts**: `build/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` in staged files

## Output Format

Provide your review as:

```
## Code Review Summary

**Status:** ✅ PASS / ⚠️ WARNINGS / ❌ FAIL

### Issues Found

[List any issues by category: Code Quality, Documentation, Cross-Layer, etc.]

### Recommendations

[Specific actions to fix issues]

### Approved Items

[List what looks good]
```

## Decision Criteria

**PASS:** No critical issues, minor suggestions only
**WARNINGS:** Non-critical issues that should be addressed but don't block commit
**FAIL:** Critical issues that must be fixed before committing

## Related Skills

- **`testing`** - Build and test verification (can run in parallel with code review)
- **`git-commit`** - Complete commit workflow
